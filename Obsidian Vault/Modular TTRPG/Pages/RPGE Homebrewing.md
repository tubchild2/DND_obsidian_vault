### Balancing and Campaign Use
To ensure your content is balanced, run it by minimum of 1 other player and your GM. They need an in-depth understanding of what you're adding. Always confirm your content is allowed in the campaign before committing to creating a character.

### Skills
1. To create a skill, first give it an exact title. Try to avoid common words to avoid getting them mixed up. If multiple homebrew kits are used, it's likely that there will be some skill overlap, so the more specific you are the better.
2. After you title it, give it a brief description. Players should know exactly what this skill is, and when they should use it.  Make sure the skill isn't too broad, as that could lead to more overlap, and potentially game breaking skills. For example, something like "quickdraw" is specific enough to warrant its own skill. On the contrary, something like, "endure" is not. 
3. Then, determine which of the 6 core stats it inherits from.
