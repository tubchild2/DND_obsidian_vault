RPG engine is unlike other TTRPGs; it contains a set of rules and a framework, but no actual content. Gameplay is a greatly simplified version of DND, but campaigns can be run in any genre, not just fantasy. 

When I say it has no content, I mean that the core rulebook contains no skills, equipment, species, classes, backgrounds, features, or conditions. All of this content can be created using the balancing system within the book. This allows for the creation of homebrew kits, which can be built specifically for a campaign, or combined into something new.

This is designed to be as fast as possible, so I'll cut right to the chase.

As a TTRPG, RPGE consists of two major roles: the players are the protagonists in the story / world crafted and maintained by the Game Master or GM. The players make choices in the world, and the GM decides what happens, typically through dice rolls modified by the player's skills. 3-6 players is recommended.

As a player, you create a character, team up, and go on a journey. As a GM, you create an adventure and GUIDE the players. Never tell them what to do or where to go, rather, gently show them where they probably should go. Never get angry if the story doesn't go how you want it to, because, realistically, it won't! And that's ok! It's way more fun that way! As the GM, you also need to know the rules of the game better than your players to prevent game breaking exploits.
