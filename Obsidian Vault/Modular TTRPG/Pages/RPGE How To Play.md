### Dice
There are 6ish dice that will commonly be used: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. If you ever need to roll a d100, you can, or you can roll 2d10 and multiply one value by 10. For d3, roll a d6 and divide the result by two and round up.

You'll see references to "checks" throughout this rulebook. Basically, you roll 1d20 when your character tries to do something that has a chance to fail. The GM sets a number that you need to meet/exceed, and if you do, you succeed. The number the GM sets is called the check's difficulty class, or DC. If you roll an unmodified 20, you automatically succeed, and natural 1 similarly always fail.

Depending on the situation, you might have even greater or even less chance of success. If the GM gives you advantage on a check, you roll 2d20, and take the higher roll. On the contrary, if you have disadvantage, you roll 2d20 and take the lower roll.

### Core Stats
There are 6 core stats for RPGE:
- Strength (STR). Physical power.
- Dexterity (DEX). Agility, reflexes, balance, precision. 
- Constitution (CON). Health, stamina, endurance.
- Intelligence (INT). Quantity of knowledge and memory.
- Wisdom (WIS). Mental fortitude and logic.
- Charisma (CHA). Social aptitude. 
Every character has these stats, and they're the basis for everything to come. Whenever your character makes a check, they add the stat that closest relates to the task at hand. For example, if a character is attempting to pick up a heavy rock, they'd roll 1d20, add their STR, and if it meets or exceeds the DC of the task, they succeed,

There's also defense (DEF) and health (HP). Defense is equal to your armor's defense + DEX (default 10+DEX). HP is equal to 10 x CON (minimum 10).

### Skills
However, your character may be better at certain tasks that aren't reflected by their more general core stats. For example, your character could've trained for forty years to draw clowns. They'd likely be very good at drawing clowns, and having them make a DEX or WIS check to paint clowns wouldn't accurately reflect their godlike mastery. That's where skills come in handy. 

Skills are formatted like so:
- Skill Name (CORE STAT) (LEVEL)
- Paint Clowns (WIS) (2)
- Attack with Broom (STR) (1) 

The name defines what type of check would trigger this skill. Then, whenever you make that check, you can add the core stat closest related to it and 3 times your level in the skill. They can be about pretty much anything. You can attempt to acquire a skill through gameplay if your GM approves it.

So, using the example above, if I made a Paint Clowns check, I'd roll 1d20 and add WIS + 6. Similarly, if I made an attack roll with a Broom, I'd roll 1d20 and add STR + 3. Skills cannot modify damage, just attack rolls (more on that in the next chapter).

### Combat
**Turns**
	Whenever combat starts, those involved are broken up into teams. Each team will receive 1 turn in combat in which every member moves and acts. The order in which these teams go is determined by each team rolling 1d20; the team with the highest roll goes first, and the rest go in descending order. A full round of combat lasts about 6 seconds. Combat ends when either team retreats, or their HP drops to zero. 
	On a turn in combat, every member of your team can do the following in no particular order:
		- Move. You can move up to your speed. You can do this in multiple parts, or not at all.
		- Action. Attack, move your movement speed again, help someone else, hide, use an item, ready another action in response to a trigger that you define, look for something, etc.
		- Bonus Action. Useless unless some feature specifically gives you something to do during one.
		- Free Action. Stuff like talking, opening doors, or other unimportant stuff doesn't count as an action.

**Attacking**
- Attacking is more complicated, and there are a couple factors involved. 
- First, make a check to see if you land your attack. Checks made to hit someone are unique, and are called "attack rolls." Roll 1d20. If it's a melee attack, add your STR. If it's a ranged attack, add your DEX. If it's a precision melee weapon like a dagger or a shortsword, you can add your STR or DEX (up to you). The DC for this check is equal to the target's defense. If you rolled a natural 20, you inflict double damage and hit no matter what. If you roll a 1, you miss no matter what. If your target is distracted or unaware of your presence, you have advantage on your attack roll.
- Next, if you land your hit, inflict the damage or other effects from the weapon you're using. Some targets might have vulnerabilities, resistances, or immunities to the weapon you're using, or to the type of damage it's inflicting. Vulnerability causes double damage, resistance causes half damage, and immunity reduces damage to 0.

### Features
Sometimes, your class, species, background, or something else will grant you a feature. Features come in three varieties:
1. Mechanical Features. These grant you unique abilities and mechanics. For example, being able to breathe underwater, fly, or master any instrument. These are active abilities that you need to remember to use.
2. Bonus Features. These grant you instant bonuses, like a new skill, a +1 to STR, or advantage on 1 check of your choice. You probably don't need to keep track of these beyond applying them.
3. Class Features. These features grant powerful, primary abilities that scale with your level in a given class. Every class is built around a handful of class features. For example, Rage could be a class feature for a barbarian class. Rage could grant +X damage, last for X turns, and add +X to attack rolls, where X is the level you have in barbarian. 

### Reading a character sheet
Character sheets have no set shape or form; they're basically just a list of stats and character traits. This is roughly how they should be organized:
- Character. This section details the name, personality traits, flaws, and goals of your character.
- Stats and Skills. This section shows your 6 core stats, defense / HP, and a list of your skills.
- Major Choices. Your background, class (and level), and species are displayed here.
- Features. This is a list of your mechanical features and class features. You can also save bonus features if you want but you don't have to.
- Inventory. This is a list of your current items, and what armor you have equipped.
