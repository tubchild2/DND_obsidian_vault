### Primary Concept 
A simplified framework for creating your own tabletop games.
- Greatly Simplified
	- Quick Character Creation
	- Quick Prep
	- Quick Combat
	- Quick Checks
	- Quick Homebrew
	- Quick to Learn
- Modular Design
	- Core Rulebook contains no species, classes, subclasses, backgrounds, skills, or equipment.
	- Core rules contain a balancing system to allow the creation of limitless homebrew.
	- Homebrewed "kits" can allow players to bring their own content.
- Stylistic Canvas
	- Compatible rules with sci-fi, fantasy, horror, survival, etc.
	- Justification for mechanics is done by the homebrewer. Metahumans, science, etc.
	- Homebrew kits can be made for a given genre, or can be focused on a given world.

**Background**

### Non-Combat
**Checks**
If you are attempting to do something, you need to perform a check. Checks require you to roll a d20 that meets or beats the difficulty class, or DC of what you're attempting to do. The DC is assigned by the DM depending on the context. You have to add the value of the closest stat to the check. For example, checks to pick something up require you to add your strength to your roll. 

**Skills**
Skills detail a specific type of check you can do. You can gain levels in specific skills that affect how likely you are to pull them off. For every level you have in a given skill, you can add +3 to checks made with that skill. So, for example, lets say you have this: "Quickdraw (DEX) (2)." This means that if you attempt to quickdraw in-game, you'd roll 1d20, add your dexterity, and then add 6.

**Levels**
You level up when your DM says so. You can gain that level in any combination of classes you want. If you multiclass, make sure to keep track of your different levels. Class Features depend on your level in that class, so you need to know what level you are in different classes.

### Combat
**Teams**
Combat is split into teams. Each team will receive 1 turn in combat in which every member moves and acts. The order in which these teams go is determined by each team rolling 1d20; the team with the highest roll goes first, and the rest go in descending order.

**Turns**
On a turn in combat, every member of your team can do the following in no particular order:
- Move. You can move up to your speed. You can do this in multiple parts, or not do it at all.
- Action. This could involve using an item, attacking, or making a check.
	- Attacking:
		- Roll 1d20 to see if you hit. Add your STR or your DEX to the roll. If you roll equal to or above their defense, you hit.
		- Deal the damage of and/or effects from the weapon.
- Bonus action. Typically, you won't have one of these unless some feature specifically gives it to you.
- Free actions. You can do stuff like talk, open doors, and other unimportant stuff like that for free.


### Creating A Homebrew Kit
**Use in a Campaign**
- Don't intentionally make something OP. Balancing is important, so get feedback from other players, or from the DM while you're making it.
- Make sure your DM reads over it before you add it to the campaign. It needs to be balanced, and fit their campaign.
- Make sure the other players in your party are aware of it and what it means before creating your character so that they can use it too.

**Skills**
1. To create a skill, first give it an exact title. Try to avoid common words to avoid getting them mixed up. If multiple homebrew kits are used, it's likely that there will be some skill overlap, so the more specific you are the better.
2. After you title it, give it a brief description. Players should know exactly what this skill is, and when they should use it.  Make sure the skill isn't too broad, as that could lead to more overlap, and potentially game breaking skills. For example, something like "quickdraw" is specific enough to warrant its own skill. On the contrary, something like, "endure" is not. 
3. Then, determine which of the 6 core stats it inherits from.

**Backgrounds**
1. First, as always, give it a descriptive and specific title.
2. Give it a definition so that players know exactly what this background means for their players.
3. Give it a bonus. Choose two of these things, or one of these things twice:
	1. Increase a stat by 1
	2. Grant 1 feature
	3. Grant 1 skill
	4. Equipment. Give players a weapon, a consumable, an item, a piece of armor, or 100 currency.

**Species**
1. Descriptive and specific name.
2. Define what the species is, where it comes from, how it works, and what it's like.
3. Determine their size in a range of feet. For example, 4-6ft tall. 
4. Determine their speed in tiles (each tile is 5ft). Average is 30ft. Don't deviate beyond 5ft without removing a bonus.
5. Give it a bonus. Choose two of these things, or one of these things twice:
	1. Increase a stat by 2.
	2. Grant 2 features.
	3. Grant 2 skills.

**Classes**
1. Descriptive and specific name
2. Define the class's core fantasy, what it is, what it does, and how your should play it.
3. Give them a class feature. Class features grant an ability that increases in power with each level in the class.
4. Determine the skills they start with
5. Determine features they start with.
6. Determine other bonuses that they gain per level:
	1. Increase a stat by 1
	2. Increase health by a value
	3. Other

**Equipment**
Weapons
- Melee or Ranged. Melee weapons have a range of 1 tile, ranged weapons have a range beyond that.
- Damage could be random (1d6 || 2d4) or fixed (5 || 3).
**Armor**
- Armor provides a boost to your defense, typically from 5-10.
Consumables
- Consumables can be used once and then they disappear. 
- They perform one function.
Items
- These don't do anything planned. This is like oil or a cheeseburger. It doesn't do anything mechanically but you can probably figure out something to do with them.
Currency
- There are multiple types, but common currency is the gold piece. You can come up with others and give them relative values to other currencies like dollars or GP.
Tools
- Tools perform a mechanical function
- They aren't used up after use.

**Features**
Class Features
- Class Features grant a powerful mechanic that scales with your level in that class.
- For example, rage could be a class feature for a barbarian class. Rage could grant you X bonus STR while enraged, last X turns, grant X bonus damage, etc.
Features
- Features grant an additional mechanic, or provide an instant bonus.
- Example 1: Strong. Strong grants +1 STR.
- Example 2: Lucky. Lucky allows you to reroll 1 dice roll per long rest.

**Conditions**
- Conditions have a mechanical effect and can be inflicted by anything designed to inflict them.
- Poison for example could last 1 hour and force disadvantage on all checks.

### Creating a Character
**Character**
- Give them a name!
- Personality traits. The more flexible the trait the better. This makes roleplay easier. Some classics include hungry, stupid, good, lawful, and optimistic. 
- Flaws. These are incredibly important to roleplay. Always remember, perfection isn't fun to play as. Give them flaws and weaknesses.
- Goals. Characters with nothing to do are incredibly boring! What do they want? Why?

**Core Stats**
- Assign these numbers to the stats of your choice: -1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2

**Defense**
- Equal to your dexterity plus your armor. You'll probably change this as your dexterity rises and you equip different armors.

**HP**
- Equal to your constitution x10. For every point you gain, add 10hp. For every point you lose, subtract 10.

**Skills**
- Keep a list of your skills. Write down your level in them, what stat they inherit from, and if you want, what homebrew kit they come from (if you want to reference them)

**Inventory**
- Keep a list of the items you have. Just use a piece of notebook paper and write down what they do. You can make this as expansive or concise as you want. The goal isn't to be an exact copy of the rules, but just enough for you to remember them. Don't write a novel.

**Features**
- You'll acquire features from your background, species, class, and maybe some other stuff idk.
- Write down what they are and what they do. Once again, don't write a novel, just enough to remember how to use them.

**Background**
- Choose a background accurate to where they grew up / what they were doing prior to the campaign. 
- Think about how it influences their character.
- Apply the changes from the background you chose.

**Species**
- Choose something that fits with their character and background.
- Apply the changes from the species you chose.
- Write down your size and speed, as it's determined by your species.

**Class**
- For every time you level up, or when you create your character, you gain 1 level.
- You can put that level into a class of your choice.
- Write down every class you have levels in, and what level you have in them.
