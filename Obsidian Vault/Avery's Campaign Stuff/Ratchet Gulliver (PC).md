## Lore and Roleplay
**Personality**
- **Determined**. Doesn't like improvising, and sticks to his plans. Wants to accomplish them more than anything, and though he will deviate according to his conscience, he wants to hurry and find ways to progress ASAP. 
- **Curious**: Loves learning and doesn't like unanswered questions. Naturally investigative. 
- **Good hearted**: He has a good sense of morality and wants to help people where possible. 
- **Bookish**: Loves reading books and wants to learn more about his craft and the world around him. 
- **Sailor:** Grew up sailing, and finds it quite relaxing. 
- **Collector:** Likes collecting trinkets and various weapons. 
- **Book Smart**. Isn't very street smart. Spent most of his life travelling from place to place, being isolated, or reading. However, he's fairly knowledgeable about the world, and very knowledgeable when it comes to ether. 
- **Detached**. Isn't loyal to a flag or creed. I.E. He's free spirited. He prefers to focus on the individual, and is typically unaware of larger conflicts. He stays out of them unless he can realistically make a difference. Because of this, he's bad with money, since he never took it crazy seriously in the first place. He was more of a self-sufficient type of guy anyways. 
- **Empathetic**. He doesn't kill, unless the people are murderers. He's always willing to negotiate though, and won't kill unless people either attack him, refuse to negotiate, or if they're pirates.

**Backstory**
- **A Family of Merchants.** Ratchet was born aboard his parents brigantine in the *Great Saline Sea*. Ratchet's parents were merchants that would buy and resell regional objects to other kingdoms for a handsome profit. Due to travelling so much, they weren't attached to any kingdom, and spent most of their time on the sea in their brigantine. Their ship (and business) was called the Saline Tide. It was an old weathered ship that had seen better days. It was 3 generations old at this point, meaning it needed frequent repairs.
- **Ma and Pa**. Ratchet's (Garrick Gulliver) father was a stout man who enjoyed fishing and sailing, while his mother (Anna Gulliver) was a free-spirited and curious woman that enjoyed reading and travelling. He picked up an appreciation for all these things from a young age. They made their own fun aboard the ship. They told legends, read books, went fishing, collected trinkets, and played games. It was a simple life. They weren't rich rich by any means, but were mostly self-reliant. 
- **Curious and Well Read.** Due to sailing with his parents, he spent his teen years travelling from manors to monasteries, making deals to access their libraries. He picked up a thing or two, and started tinkering with e-tech as a hobby. He was allowed to explore the towns they stayed in as long as he was careful and came back early. 
- **Davy Jones' Locker.** His parents were going to dock in *Styxas*. While a day's journey off from *Nagoyor Port*, they spotted the black and Jacinth sails of pirates. They attempted to flee, but to the dismay of everyone on board, the Pirates were of a higher caliber than previously thought--they had a Kraken under their command. Its tentacles ripped his parents from the ship and pulled them into the waters below. The Pirates boarded the ship and began emptying it. Ratchet hid in a barrel, and peered through a small hole, where he spotted the captain. It was a horned dragonborn wearing a black leather outfit with a Jacinth eye on it. After returning to their ship the brigantine was smashed clean in two by the Kraken, and Ratchet plummeted into the *Ocean Wide*. Suddenly, he felt a flood of ether surge through him as his Folcryst Gland activated. Using mage hand and mending, he swam above the waves and fashioned a raft.  
- **A New Home**. After floating to shore, he bought himself a small sloop to live out of. It's currently docked in *Nagoyor Port*. His sloop is called the Saline Tide after his parent's brigantine. It's been 6 years since the encounter with the kraken, and he's been exploring Styxas to further his plan.

**Agenda**
1. Unlock the secrets of e-tech and funneling by either partnering with, or stealing from the Folcrithian. 
2. Research and track down schematics for an anti-kraken weapon.
3. Gain enough combat and adventuring experience to outmatch and solo a large group of people.
4. Learn the identities of the pirates. Find out why they raided them.
5. Kill their Kraken with the weapon, then take them out himself. 

**Appearance**
- Slim build.
- Brown eyes.
- Blue robe covering his armor
- A belt with all kinds of pouches and tools strapped to it.
- A dagger sheathed on his side
- Medium length messy hair
- Blue flat merchant's cap
- A large backpack for carrying all of his trinkets.
