Campaign Heart

### Constants of Arcohaem
- Ethology is common, but not everyone uses it, and fewer understand it. The rules are loose and flexible.
- Set in Serendipita, in the Arcohaem region
- There are approximately ~4000 people living in that region

### The Tone
- Peaceful. Doesn't involve the fate of the world.
- Fantastical. Industrial Era Adventure Time.
- Sincere. Doesn't poke fun at itself.
- Epic. Themes of power, conquest, revenge, justice, etc.
- Emotional. Doesn't shy from making people feel things.
- Character Driven. Very light plot, very heavy emphasis on player choice.

### The Quest
Some Tibetan inspired temples are fostering a growing number of white dragons. They have wyrmlings, young white dragons, and even a couple of adults. However, according to rumor, they might have gotten all of this started due to the influence of an ancient white dragon that they uncovered.


### Session 1
Zoom into central Arcohaem. We pan over the mountains of Stillwake and down into a small, town comprised of igloos and huts bordering a frigid forest lake. The town's name is Hephestus. It's sort of like if the Inuit of Alaska and Greenland were mixed with the attitudes of a Canadian.

Introduce what each character is doing, while making sure to put them in a couple, close-proximity groups.

Goals:
1. Introduce the world.
2. Bring the party together.
3. Hook the players.
4. Put them on a light, low-stakes mission set in the world.
5. Keep the party together via character catalysts, and close-quarters dangerous situations.
6. Test their cooperation with a battle that incorporates battlefield actions.
7. Set them on a light, low-stakes adventure set in the world.
