- [ ] Part 2: Long Live the Republic
	- [ ] Introduction of the characters
		- [ ] Loyal to the republic
	- [ ] Introduction of the world
		- [ ] Chunky industrial era.
		- [ ] Recognition and reputation is extremely important to the Arcohaemian military.
		- [ ] Orwellian propaganda featuring the Frigoshians and Chancellor Kaul, and some featuring Chancellor Kaul preaching some moral lessons. Always help those in need. Don't be racist.
		- [ ] Make them think the Republic is great.
		- [ ] The Republic has a ton of weapons and soldiers. Their firepower is borderline unmatched.
		- [ ] There are some Republic heroes that put the [[PCs - Arcohaem|Wolves of Arcohaem]] to shame.
	- [ ] Introduction of the quest
		- [ ] They're fed several lies about how Frigoshians look, think, and act by Commander Kragknull. They're painted as the  black and white monstrous enemies that must be crushed. They're brutal, savage, cannibalistic, fascist, and stupid.
		- [ ] They receive E-Tech "communicators" that grant them a passive buff and allow the Republic to track their location and communicate with them remotely (and more that they don't know about). They're not allowed to remove or touch them after they're installed. They can be used for communication with their commander when necessary.
		- [ ] They receive Honor Books, which contain the code of conduct for soldiers, penned by Chancellor Kaul himself. It's a bunch of morals.
		- [ ] They receive their mission, which is to stop a dragon breeding program in [[Frigoshia]] before they destroy [[Arcohaem]]. No one has entered into [[Frigoshia]] and survived. The farthest most troops get are the outer walls, before they're swiftly destroyed.
		- [ ] It's a top secret mission. Only them and the chancellor know about it. The chancellor actually recommended the group, which was an odd choice according to Kragknull, so they better step up.
		- [ ] They cannot directly invade [[Frigoshia]], and they cannot divert troops away from the capital in case they go through with the plan. They need to stop them before it's too late or the Republic will fall and destabilize the entire economy of Serendipita. 
		- [ ] They decide where to go next on the map.


#### Chapter 2 - The Code of Kaul
- [ ] They have a brief combat encounter.
- [ ] Their communicators go off. Chancellor Kaul is on the other end. Commander Kragknull defected from the military and has gone AWOL. He committed several acts of treason, sabotage, and assault. He's currently on the run, and is framed to be a terrible person. Kaul will now be personally overseeing the mission while they look for a replacement.
- [ ] Kaul's Honor Book says that you should always help those in need. They help someone that's wounded that turns out to be a [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]]. They're actually super chill.
- [ ] Kaul doesn't follow the moral code he promotes. He's a little hypocritical. He doesn't think they should've helped the enemy, considering what a large risk that was.
- [ ] Kaul uses weaponized incompetence to give them bad, destructive advice during a combat encounter.
- [ ] Disobedience causes nosebleeds.
- [ ] Kaul apologizes, and backs off for now.
- [ ] They see how their violence bred more violence, and some innocents got hurt.

#### Chapter 3 - Flesh and Blood
- [ ] They arrive in [[Frigoshia]]. It is... not what they were expecting! The actual citizens want the war to be over. They aren't savages, they're just people. The people who are in charge of [[Frigoshia]] are definitely corrupt monsters.
- [ ] Their communicators begin beeping during the night. If investigated, you can find that they were made in Terragon (?). Terragon is known for making advanced computer-like E-Tech. There's also a large amount of strange, unidentifiable fluid that's half drained. There's something more to these that they don't understand.
	- [ ] If asked about the Terragon thing, "Oh yes, we only want the finest quality communication devices for our soldiers. You do understand the gravity of this situation, do you not?"
	- [ ] If asked about the fluid, "It's likely some form of coolant or byproduct. I'm not an expert but I'm sure our top scientists didn't make some kind of error if that's what you're suggesting."
- [ ] They're informed that "reinforcements" are coming to accompany them on this last leg of the journey. The senate deemed the mission too important for them to handle on their own, but now that they've paved a clear path, Captain Terrik and his men should be able to arrive shortly.

#### Chapter 4 - Good Soldiers Follow Orders
- [ ] Captain Terrik and his men arrive. They're suspiciously high ranking; they're like Kaul's personal guard. They're here to "help" them, but Terrik is rude, selfish, and combative. He's immediately controlling, pulls rank on them, and begins telling them what to do.
- [ ] They aren't allowed to communicate with Kaul anymore. All communications must go through Terrik. He regularly communicates with Kaul privately. 
- [ ] He's attempting to keep information from them, but has them outnumbered and outranked.
- [ ] They arrive at the Dragon Breeding Program. They have a wyrmling of every chromatic dragon (black, blue, green, red, white), and hundreds more eggs. They're all nuts! 
- [ ] Kaul leads them directly into a trap that nearly gets them killed. More weaponized incompetence. He's a danger to everyone there. They get separated, and are briefly not under the command of Captain Terrik.
- [ ] The Dragon Breeding Program is once again, not what they were expecting. They're breeding way more types of dragons, have very different orders, and might not even be working for Brisk directly; it's more of an office rental situation with [[Frigoshia]]. The real person in charge of the program is someone with the initial "M."
- [ ] Captain Terrik orders them to forget what they saw and to preserve some the eggs for "study," instead of destroying them... but we all know what they plan to do with them. This is unthinkable considering everything they've learned about the reality of the war, and how suspicious the republic is being. But... good soldiers follow orders. What do they do?
- [ ] Terrik attempts to execute the party for treason. They're now wanted, have to remove their communicators, and they have to escape [[Frigoshia]].
- [ ] Level up (13-14)
- [ ] Distribute level 14 loot

#### Chapter 5 - Beneath the Republic
- [ ] They're forced to retreat through a Republic city-state during. The Frigoshians and the Republic Army is trying to kill them. As refugees, they need to destroy or hide anything that could give their identity and allegiance away.
- [ ] They learn how corrupt the Republic is. Several of the senators and representatives are working for their own private gain. There are hundreds of third parties that are exploiting the conflict on both sides.
- [ ] They are met by Commander Kragknull, who's been searching for them. He's filled with deep regret and feels unbelievably betrayed by Kaul. He's been investigating the Republic and [[Frigoshia]] trying to learn more, and he found one of Kaul's hidden bunkers, which was supposedly used as some kind of meeting place between Kaul and Brisk. They should be able to learn the truth there.
- [ ] Kragknull reveals some important information
	- [ ] He had begun to become suspicious of the Republic after catching a corrupt senator a few years back. When he received the communicator, he was instantly suspicious. He learned that it was dispersing an invisible aerial sedative that increased obedience in those who wore them.
	- [ ] He wanted answers, so he began spying on Kaul. Kaul and Brisk are both working for someone called "Malfaust." The whole war was set up by him for some reason, and the leaders have been manipulating their peoples into conflict this whole time.
	- [ ] Kaul wanted the mission to fail, (Kragknull doesn't know why), so he chose them, expecting them to fail. They likely would've died if the senate hadn't voted to send some of Kaul's private guard too. Kaul had corrupted his guard (Terrik) though, so he ensured they completed the mission how he wanted.
- [ ] Kragknull sacrifices himself to protect the party from the Republic army.

#### Chapter 6 - The Pact of Malfaust
- [ ] Venturing to the secret bunker, they learn the full truth about the origins of the war. An adult red dragon named Malfaust met with Kaul and Brisk and has been behind everything.
- [ ] Malfaust pushed Kaul to usher in the rapid technological changes, knowing the impact it'd have on the Frigoshians. Malfaust told him that it'd help their people to live better, healthier, wealthier lives. It would mean power, safety, and security! Peace would be in their grasp if anyone ever attempted an invasion. Kaul agreed to work for Malfaust, so he used the Republic to start the conflict to amass wealth, weapons, and knowledge for him. Kaul doesn't agree with Malfaust on everything, but he truly does serve what he believes are the best interests of his people.
- [ ] Malfaust pushed Brisk into independence to maintain their people's cultural identity. Brisk was already a cultural fanatic, so this worked out nicely. All Brisk would need to do was fake the conflict to motivate the people into approving a dragon breeding program. Brisk would need to find and grow Dragon eggs for his chromatic brethren to ensure enough damage could be done to conquer all of Serendipita. Brisk is freaking nuts and is fully on board with supporting Malfaust if it means preserving his people's culture.
- [ ] Malfaust is going to wipe out both the Republic and [[Frigoshia]], and reform them under the new "Kingdom of Malfaust." He's then going to stockpile riches and power and his dragon children decimate Serendipita in a series of violent invasions.
- [ ] They uncover the location of Malfaust's lair. It's deep within the Volcanoes of Pyrk.

- [ ] Part 3 - Days to Come
	- [ ] The destruction of Malfaust, Brisk, and Kaul has created a power vacuum. Who will fill it? What are their intentions? What will happen to the Republic and to [[Frigoshia]] without their leaders? What is the future of [[Arcohaem]]? 
	- [ ] There were more dragons... somewhere. Obviously Malfaust and his goons would've had to have gotten the eggs from somewhere. Where? Are there more?
	- [ ] Why did Kaul attempt to take eggs for himself with Terrik? What was he playing at? 
	- [ ] Who made the communicators, and for what purpose? What does Terragon have to do with any of this?
