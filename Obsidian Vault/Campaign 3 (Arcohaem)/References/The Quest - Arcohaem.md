#### Chapter 1 - The [[PCs - Arcohaem|Wolves of Arcohaem]]
- [ ] Introduce everyone's characters
	- [ ] All fiercely loyal to the republic, and all anti-[[Frigoshia]]. 
- [ ] Part 1: In Medias Res
	- [ ] Theater of the mind
	- [ ] Krothmire
		- [ ] Dead prisoners no one is bothering to clean them up; they're just piling up in the corner.
		- [ ] Prisoners are forced to work in the forge.
		- [ ] Guards are covering their faces, treating the prisoners with cruel indifference, have deep distorted voices, and don't speak in common.
	- [ ] Contact
		- [ ] You begin to hear a loud beeping sound coming from your pockets. 
		- [ ] A small marble triangular beacon no larger than the palm of your hand with a glowing light in the center is beeping. It's transmitting an encoded message from your commander:
			- [ ] EMERGENCY. BY ORDER OF THE CHANCELLOR, RETURN TO CAPITAL IMMEDIATELY. ONGOING MISSION NULLIFIED - CMR KRAGKNULL.![[emergencynotice.wav]]
	- [ ] Level up (10-11)
- [ ] Part 2: Long Live the Republic
	- [ ] Establish the propaganda
		- [ ] Where will you tell your children you were during the war? It shows a dad who's deeply ashamed.
		- [ ] It shows a [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] inside a child's bedroom with a weapon. It's captioned, "you didn't act fast enough."
		- [ ] Don't stand for terrorism! Report [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] activity.
		- [ ] Fighting for the Republic means independence, justice, and heroism.
		- [ ] It's a village burning down due to a [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] invasion. It's captioned, "He stayed silent, now they're all dead. Report [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] activity."
		- [ ] Everyone's enlisted - what about you?
		- [ ] It shows a soldier waving goodbye to a little girl. It's captioned, "For her future"
		- [ ] It shows a group of [[Frigoshia|Frigoshians]] running away from one Republic soldiers. "[[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]]? Or just a coward in Fur."
		- [ ] [[Frigoshia]] is fighting to live in squalor, don't let them win!
	- [ ] Let them explore
		- [ ] Soldiers on parade
		- [ ] Trains transporting refined Eathyst.
		- [ ] Propaganda
	- [ ] Senate Building
		- [ ] Protected by several guards accompanied by Commander Kragknull. He welcomes them back to the Republic and leads them to the briefing room, which has 3 tall windows overlooking the city, and busts of Chancellor Kaul.
- [ ] Part 3: Commander Kragknull's Exposition Dump... *ahem* Mission Briefing.
	- [ ] Do you know what I've seen over my years as a commander? Savagery. I've seen my own friends get killed with no hesitation, no mercy, no weakness, no nothing. I don't believe they want to act human. They fight and kill without showing their faces, or speaking, or showing any empathy, all to live in squalor. It confounds me why some of our own citizens go out of their way to protest this conflict like we're somehow at fault here. In my eyes, if they want to act like savages, we reserve the right to treat them as such. I didn't believe anything they could do could surprise me at this point, but this most recent development has rocked me to my very core.
	- [ ] Two weeks ago, 5 of our soldiers were separated in the heat of battle and got lost wandering the plains. While wandering, they discovered a [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] transport carrying incubation equipment, and a dragon egg. This has led the Senate to believe that the [[Frigoshia|Frigoshians]] are running a covert dragon breeding program, likely for military use. A single adult dragon could decimate [[Hephaestus]] before we even got a chance to respond. We don't know how many they have, and we can't get an army past the Howling Front to stop them.
	- [ ] So, that's where you come in. Chancellor Kaul, the Senate, myself, and you are the only ones aware of this mission's existence. It's simple, but far from easy, and has 3 parts.
		- [ ] First, you need to infiltrate [[Frigoshia]]. None of our armies have ever been able to push through the Howling Front, so you'll need to be clever when going through or around it.
		- [ ] Second, you need to locate the dragon breeding program. It's likely hidden within the [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] capital [[Frigoshia|Torhild]]. We have no reconnaissance beyond the front, so expect the worst. You need to be fast, quiet, and ready for a fight. Don't trust anyone there; remember, they start training to kill at 8. You'll likely need to perform some light espionage to pinpoint its exact location.
		- [ ] Third, you need to destroy it, and eliminate any living dragons and eggs. It is of the utmost importance you don't miss any, because if even one is left, it could spell disaster for the Republic, and for all of Serendipita. 
	- [ ] Finally: Chancellor Kaul personally selected you for this mission, which was... not a popular choice within the senate. You're all good soldiers, but your track record is inconsistent. I trust you to do this mission, but most don't, so you need to step up.
	- [ ] To support your mission, you'll each be given:
		- [ ] 5000gp
		- [ ] A communicator
			- [ ] Allows secure communication with one or more allies at once. You can contact me with this device if necessary. Do not contact Chancellor Kaul. 
			- [ ] Do not remove or tamper with the devices.
			- [ ] Grants +2 to initiative rolls when within 100ft of an ally.
		- [ ] And one of these 5 items
			- [ ] Hat of Ethology. DC 10 Arcana check to use unknown scholar spin once per long rest.
			- [ ] Immovable Rod. Button on one end to make it fixed in place. DC 30 to move it 10ft. 8000lbs.
			- [ ] Gloves of Thievery. +5 to sleight of hand checks.  
			- [ ] Ring of Protection. +1 to AC and saves. Universally helpful.
			- [ ] +3 Dagger that teleports to the user as a bonus action.
	- [ ] This is a map of [[Arcohaem]] to assist you with planning your mission. I'll leave you to that, but contact me if you need assistance. 

#### Chapter 2 - Remember... Remember Why We Fight, Wolves.
- [ ] Commander Kragknull checks in on them and gives them more advice. He's pretty helpful. Establish his good relationship with them
- [ ] They visit a neutral village with a [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] battalion waiting to ambush it. They're one battalion under [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] Captain Alric.
- [ ] They form a bond with some of the people there.
- [ ] The [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] battalion invades, and they're absolutely hateable and brutal. They're killing, abusing, stealing, and burning without a second thought.
	- [ ] Violent Natured
	- [ ] Hypocritical
	- [ ] Dislikes people they like
	- [ ] Targets the elderly, children, and animals
	- [ ] Intimidating
- [ ] The family they formed a bond with are fatally wounded by [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] warriors. Fake them out that they're ok, and then have them die an unfair death.
- [ ] Make the [[Frigoshia|Frigoshians]] as hateable as possible
- [ ] Level up (11-12)
- [ ] Distribute level 12 loot
	- [ ] 1 Common
	- [ ] 1 Uncommon
	- [ ] 2 Rare
	- [ ] 1 Very Rare

#### Chapter 3 - First Blood
- [ ] Commander Kragknull checks in on them. He informs them that the overseer of the Republic bank was assassinated during the night, and all of the files and contracts were burned. The person responsible is still at large, but the leading theory is that there is a [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] spy aiming to cover their tracks. Commander Kragknull states that he's going to personally look into the situation, because he's suspicious of someone. [[PCs - Arcohaem|Aeroneiros]]' contract for infinite inventing may be threatened by this.
- [ ] They find Captain Alric, who was directly responsible for the invasion in the last chapter. They have an opportunity to get revenge.
- [ ] If they get revenge, the [[Frigoshia|Frigoshians]] retaliate by following them to their next stop and killing a lot of innocent people to try and kill the party. They see how their violence bred more violence, and innocents got really hurt.
- [ ] Level up (12-13)
- [ ] Distribute level 13 loot
	- [ ] 1 Common

	- [ ] 2 Rare 
	- [ ] 1 Very Rare

#### Chapter 4 - The Code of Kaul
- [ ] Chancellor Kaul contacts them. Commander Kragknull defected from the military and has gone AWOL. He committed several acts of treason, sabotage, and assault. It's believed he was responsible for the assassination. He's currently on the run, and is framed to be a terrible person. Kaul will now be personally overseeing the mission while they look for a replacement.
- [ ] Kaul gives them bad, destructive advice. Kaul apologizes.
- [ ] Disobedience causes nosebleeds.
- [ ] They help someone that's wounded that's super nice and chill. They end up being [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]], which causes them to question some of the things they've learned. They oppose Republic philosophy and have a completely different view of the war.
- [ ] Kaul doesn't follow the moral code he promotes. He's a little hypocritical. He doesn't think they should've helped the enemy, considering what a large risk that was.

#### Chapter 5 - Flesh and Blood
- [ ] They're informed that "reinforcements" are coming to accompany them on this last leg of the journey. The senate deemed the mission too important for them to handle on their own, but now that they've paved a clear path, Captain Terrik and his men should be able to arrive shortly. 
- [ ] They're close to crossing into [[Frigoshia]], but it's... not what they were expecting! The actual citizens, not the soldiers, don't want to fight at all. They want the war to be over. They aren't savages, they're just more people. This could totally be this village just being far from the capital, or not being super involved or something. This isn't the belly of the beast.
- [ ] Kaul informs them that the direct path will be monitored. Their only means of entering the capital undetected is to go through the Cherub's Pass. It involves moving through creepy half-buried temples and ravines. There's no one for miles, and it's supposedly home to a dangerous monster. It'll be risky, but it's much safer than the alternative.
- [ ] https://open.spotify.com/album/2UizxLjONIyVano2kIKpcg?si=CyMumtrUSsu7t6srpgKyUw
- [ ] Things get creepy while they're exploring. There are unsettling noises, strange details, and an implied presence that isn't shown. They cannot contact Kaul anymore, so they don't even know if they're navigating the maze of decaying temples correctly. Their completely alone, and completely lost. They feel like they're being watched, and they can even catch glimpses of something out of their eyeline. 
- [ ] Suddenly, they're attacked by a very peculiar monster. It's something that shouldn't be native here, it's from southern [[Arcohaem]]. Anyways, they kill it. Emphasize how stupid and monstrous it is.
- [ ] Suddenly, a fierce blizzard hits, forcing them to take shelter in a strangely placed mansion. When indoors, they drop off their loot in the main room, and then they get separated exploring the mansion. 
	- [ ] Do things that imply that everyone has secrets that only the DM knows about their character, and that this is somehow important to that. Do things like point, look at people while saying things, and act excited about things you shouldn't be.
	- [ ] Physically separate the players. Each one can go to a different room, or go in a small group. Make a physical map to encourage them to split up and explore. While separated, continue with the creepy stuff. This temple building has some sketchy origins, and it's weird that Kaul even knew about it come to think about it.
- [ ] When they all return (and physically group back together) they find that someone called Kaul and stole a bunch of their stuff. They're missing some important stuff too; this is a bad setback. There wasn't anyone for miles, this would've required someone very intelligent to do it, and everyone was separated, so it would've had to have been someone in the group... right?  (NOTE: TURN ON EACH OTHER LIKE THE PEN EPISODE OF COMMUNITY).
- [ ] Their communicators begin beeping during the night. If investigated, you can find that they were made in Terragon (?). Terragon is known for making advanced computer-like E-Tech. There's also a large amount of strange, unidentifiable grey fluid that's half drained. There's something more to these that they don't understand.
	- [ ] If Kaul is asked about the Terragon thing, "Oh yes, we only want the finest quality communication devices for our soldiers. You do understand the gravity of this situation, do you not?"
	- [ ] If Kaul is asked about the fluid, "It's likely some form of coolant or byproduct. I'm not an expert but I'm sure our top scientists didn't make some kind of error if that's what you're suggesting."
- [ ] Level up (13-14)
- [ ] Distribute level 14 loot
	- [ ] 1 Uncommon
	- [ ] 2 Rare
	- [ ] 1 Very Rare

#### Chapter 6 - Kin
- [ ] Entering into the capital of [[Frigoshia]].
- [ ] They need to spy around to find the location of the dragon breeding program.
- [ ] While spying, they see some of what they were told, but also the other side of it. The people who are in charge of [[Frigoshia]] are definitely corrupt monsters, and over half of the population is in the military. What they were told wasn't entirely false, but it was a very poor summation of the problem.
- [ ] They find the program. It's out of the city, but very well hidden.

#### Chapter 7 - Good Soldiers Follow Orders
- [ ] Captain Terrik and his men arrive. 
	- [ ] They're suspiciously high ranking; they're like Kaul's personal guard. 
	- [ ] They're here to "help" them, but Terrik is rude, selfish, and combative. He pulls rank on them.
	- [ ] The party isn't allowed to communicate with Kaul anymore. All communications must go through Terrik. He regularly communicates with Kaul privately. 
	- [ ] Terrik chooses to keep important updates from Kaul to himself.
	- [ ] Terrik uses one of the items that was stolen from their camp. Whenever they ask him where he got it, he denies any involvement and says he got it from the same place they did.
	- [ ] He denies things he's clearly done in front of people like Lex Luthor. "I don't know what dog you're talking about."
- [ ] They arrive at the Dragon Breeding Program. They have a wyrmling of every chromatic dragon (black, blue, green, red, white), and hundreds more eggs. They're all nuts! 
- [ ] Kaul leads them directly into a trap that nearly gets them killed. More lies. He's a danger to everyone there. They get separated, and are briefly not under the command of Captain Terrik.
- [ ] The Dragon Breeding Program is once again, not what they were expecting. They're breeding way more types of dragons, have very different orders, and might not even be working for Brisk directly; it's more of an office rental situation with [[Frigoshia]]. The real person in charge of the program is someone with the initial "M."
- [ ] Captain Terrik orders them to forget what they saw and to preserve some the eggs for "study," instead of destroying them... but we all know what they plan to do with them. This is unthinkable considering everything they've learned about the reality of the war, and how suspicious the republic is being. But... good soldiers follow orders. What do they do?
- [ ] Terrik attempts to execute the party for treason. They're now wanted, have to remove their communicators, and they have to escape [[Frigoshia]].
- [ ] Level up (14-15)
- [ ] Distribute level 15 loot
	- [ ] 1 Uncommon

	- [ ] 1 Legendary

#### Chapter 8 - Beneath the Republic
- [ ] They're forced to retreat through a Republic city-state during. The [[Frigoshia|Frigoshians]] and the Republic Army is trying to kill them. As refugees, they need to destroy or hide anything that could give their identity and allegiance away.
- [ ] They learn how corrupt the Republic is. Several of the senators and representatives are working for their own private gain. There are hundreds of third parties that are exploiting the conflict on both sides.
- [ ] They are met by Commander Kragknull, who's been searching for them. He's filled with deep regret and feels unbelievably betrayed by Kaul. He's been investigating the Republic and [[Frigoshia]] trying to learn more, and he found one of Kaul's hidden bunkers, which was supposedly used as some kind of meeting place between Kaul and Brisk. They should be able to learn the truth there.
- [ ] Kragknull reveals some important information
	- [ ] He had begun to become suspicious of the Republic after catching a corrupt senator a few years back. When he received the communicator, he was instantly suspicious. He learned that it was dispersing an invisible aerial sedative that increased obedience in those who wore them.
	- [ ] He wanted answers, so he began spying on Kaul. Kaul and Brisk are both working for someone called "Malfaust." The whole war was set up by him for some reason, and the leaders have been manipulating their peoples into conflict this whole time.
	- [ ] Kaul wanted the mission to fail, (Kragknull doesn't know why), so he chose them, expecting them to fail. They likely would've died if the senate hadn't voted to send some of Kaul's private guard too. Kaul had corrupted his guard (Terrik) though, so he ensured they completed the mission how he wanted.
- [ ] Kragknull sacrifices himself to protect the party from the Republic army. 
- [ ] Level up (15 - 16)
- [ ] Distribute level 16 loot

#### Chapter 9 - The Pact of Malfaust
- [ ] Venturing to the secret bunker, they learn the full truth about the origins of the war. An adult red dragon named Malfaust met with Kaul and Brisk and has been behind everything.
- [ ] Restricted National Tapes akin to the Incredibles NSA tapes.
- [ ] Malfaust pushed Kaul to usher in the rapid technological changes, knowing the impact it'd have on the [[Frigoshia|Frigoshians]]. Malfaust told him that it'd help their people to live better, healthier, wealthier lives. It would mean power, safety, and security! Peace would be in their grasp if anyone ever attempted an invasion. Kaul agreed to work for Malfaust, so he used the Republic to start the conflict to amass wealth, weapons, and knowledge for him. Kaul doesn't agree with Malfaust on everything, but he truly does serve what he believes are the best interests of his people.
- [ ] Malfaust pushed Brisk into independence to maintain their people's cultural identity. Brisk was already a cultural fanatic, so this worked out nicely. All Brisk would need to do was fake the conflict to motivate the people into approving a dragon breeding program. Brisk would need to find and grow Dragon eggs for his chromatic brethren to ensure enough damage could be done to conquer all of Serendipita. Brisk is freaking nuts and is fully on board with supporting Malfaust if it means preserving his people's culture.
- [ ] Malfaust is going to wipe out both the Republic and [[Frigoshia]], and reform them under the new "Kingdom of Malfaust." He's then going to stockpile riches and power and his dragon children decimate Serendipita in a series of violent invasions.
- [ ] They uncover the location of Malfaust's lair. It's deep within the Volcanoes of Pyrk.

#### Chapter 10 - Elegy to [[Arcohaem]]
- [ ] Entering Malfaust's volcanic lair, killing his minions, and then killing him. End the civil war, and prevent calamity.
- [ ] Part 1 - The Mark of Malfaust
	- [ ] They enter the volcanic cavernous dungeon that is Malfaust's lair.
	- [ ] Wyrmlings and several soldiers. The party needs to kill them to progress.

	- [ ] Distribute Level 18 loot

		- [ ] 2 Legendary
- [ ] Part 2 - Malfaust
	- [ ] The battle with Malfaust (CR 17), and both Kaul and Brisk (CR 5 each) is very difficult and they could very well die.
- [ ] Part 3 - Days to Come
	- [ ] The destruction of Malfaust, Brisk, and Kaul has created a power vacuum. Who will fill it? What are their intentions? What will happen to the Republic and to [[Frigoshia]] without their leaders? What is the future of [[Arcohaem]]? 
	- [ ] There were more dragons... somewhere. Obviously Malfaust and his goons would've had to have gotten the eggs from somewhere. Where? Are there more?
	- [ ] Why did Kaul attempt to take eggs for himself with Terrik? What was he playing at? 
	- [ ] Who made the communicators, and for what purpose? What does Terragon have to do with any of this?
