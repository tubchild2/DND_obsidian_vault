### History
12c 400
- The 9 tribes of [[Arcohaem]] are founded
- There are also 6 other Tribes that live in the deep south or far west that are independent from the republic.
	- Qorra. SOUTH
	- Kallik, SOUTH
	- Sesi. SOUTH
	- Kari. EAST
	- Solvi. EAST
	- Skalth. EAST
- There's also Lemnaeus, which is an independent town that's not technically in [[Arcohaem]], but it's a very important port to the region. It's at the easternmost point. 

12c 604
- The Republic of [[Arcohaem]] was founded from the 9 tribes of [[Arcohaem]].

12c 1255
- Kry Brisk becomes the King of Frigoshia. 
- Caldus Kaul becomes the Chancellor of the Republic with help from Hades. He was motivated by maximum profit and was a popular senator at the time, which helped him to convince people to make the changes.

12c 1256
- The Republic--especially the capital, Hephaestus--experience rapid changes amidst the industrial revolution. Transportation, government, weaponry, culture, and trade all undergo a complete metamorphosis. Chancellor Kaul convinced people that the changes, though major, would allow them access to food, and supplies, and an easier way of life free from the primitive life they're currently living. Railroads were built between all members of the republic but Frigoshia.
- The Frigoshian people rejected the rapid changes; they want to keep their culture and way of life in tact. They see the industrial revolution and E-Tech as a worldly cancer. The Frigoshian senator was assassinated by the Republic for treason, prompting a civil war.
- Frigoshia controlled more territory than the other tribes, and their people were already skilled warriors before the war. Their war-crime ridden campaign butchered northwestern [[Arcohaem]]. They slaughtered innocent people, bombed towns, and operated with sickening indifference.

12c 1259
- The Republic's new Eathyst powered weapons matched Frigoshian skill, leading to a brutal territorial tug-of-war. Neither could get the upper hand. 

12c 1265
- The war has raged on, with neither side making any major progress.
- Relying on thinning Yak products and root vegetables, the Frigoshian people are beginning to starve. Food is being diverted away from the lower-class and towards the military.
- A Frigoshian diplomat was sent to visit the republic to extend an olive branch, but was publicly stabbed to death by Republic guards.
- King Kry Brisk greenlights a secret mission to incubate and breed Red Dragons in the volcanic caverns beneath Frigoshia. He plans to use them to ambush Hephaestus and win the war once and for all. He just needs to be careful to control them.

12c 1266 
- Arcohaemian spies uncovered King Brisk's draconic plot. They cannot directly invade Frigoshia, and they cannot divert troops away from the capital in case they go through with the plan. They need to stop them before it's too late or the Republic will fall and destabilize the entire economy of Serendipita. 
- Chancellor Kaul and the Arcohaemian senate summon a team of specialists to infiltrate Frigoshia, assassinate Kry, and destroy the young dragons before it's too late.
- Factions within both the Republic and Frigoshia despise the war and protest against its continuation.
