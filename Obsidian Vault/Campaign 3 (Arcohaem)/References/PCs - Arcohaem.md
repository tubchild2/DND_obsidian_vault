The Wolves of [[Arcohaem]] used to be a party of 8.
- Fire Genasi Sorcerer named Vaesha. Hotheaded pyromaniac. She got bored easily and was obsessed with fire. She died in an explosion due to the premature detonation of one of Aeroneiros' devices. They didn't get along, so it's partly suspicious, but unlikely that it was Aeroneiros' fault. Theme song: Mars, the Bringer of War.
- Aarakocra Fighter named Arrius. A noble and deeply loyal fighter that inspired those around him to keep going. During the battle of Kedrik, he gave his life to save a family of Harengon from a [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] mage. Theme song: Dear Mr. Fantasy.
- Thri-Kreen Bard named Rikkix. An incredibly happy and kind guy. He kept people's spirits high and helped them to sweet-talk their way out of trouble. He was separated during a blizzard, and hasn't been found. Theme song: Cavalo-Ferro.

Past Missions:
- Duel with the Red Knight. The Red Knight is a mysterious third-party that roams the Arcohaemian plains searching for murderers. He's slaughtered countless camps of [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] and Republic soldiers. Back when Arrius was still in the party, he had an encounter with him. The Red Knight created a wall of fire around them and challenged Arrius to a duel. Arrius outfought him 3 times, so the Red Knight decided to let him go. He was never seen by the Wolves again. Legends say he was cursed with more power than he can ever use, so now he roams as a symbol of power and justice. A mythological symbol of the faults in both sides of the war.
