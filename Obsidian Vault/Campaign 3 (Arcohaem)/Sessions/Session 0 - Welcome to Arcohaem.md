### PART 1: WELCOME TO SERENDIPITA
This world was created by Avery. I'm a member of the Styxas campaign and the Terragon campaign, but I'm DMing the [[Arcohaem]] campaign.

The world of Serendipita is remarkably varied. It's a high fantasy sandbox where anything you can imagine probably already happened.

Magic doesn't exist. Everything unnatural in Serendipita is powered by a particle called Ether. It's invisible, and intangible until condensed and shaped. It's remarkably important to all of society, but it's still poorly understood. Ether enters the world through "valves," which are points in space, time, people, or a whole other endless list.

Funnelers can use ether. Funnelers are born with the Folcryst gland, which draws Ether directly from its dimension and condenses it into a usable form that the funneler can shape. Funnelers are inert until they unlock their abilities by "flooding." These moments, colloquially referred to as "floods," typically involve intense stress, trauma, or exposure to Ether-rich environments. Funnelers aren't abundant or rare.

E-Tech harnesses Ether using Eathyst. Eathyst is crystalized Ether. Eathyst is mined in the deserts of Styxas, refined in the volcanoes of [[Arcohaem]], and studied with deep secrecy in Fol'Gar'Eth. E-Tech is extremely varied; it's used in everything from trains to tools.

Also, as a side note, mankind lacks the need to worship in this world. There aren't religions in this universe. Religion aligned classes are tweaked to avoid that.

We don't use magic in this world, so please use this terminology:
- Cast --> Use
- Spell --> Spin
- Spellcaster --> Funneler or Ether User
- Magic --> Ether
- Magic Item --> E-Tech or Ether Item

### PART 2: WELCOME TO [[ARCOHAEM]]
**[[Arcohaem]]**
[[Arcohaem]] is a large, arctic region of Serendipita. It's heavily inspired by the Inuit and Vikings. Visually, it pulls from Tibetan temples, Canadian-Victorian Architecture, Brutalism, Viking Villages, and Inuit Tribes. 

The people of [[Arcohaem]] are mostly traditional and primitive. They grow blackroot and featherweed, knead blubberbread, forage frostberries, and hunt mammoths, and fish for icetail eel and arctic snapper.

[[Arcohaem]] was originally a group of independent tribes, but centuries later, [[the Republic of Arcohaem]] formed to represent the collective interests of all of the tribes. Things went peacefully until 1256. When the Industrial Revolution and the modern advancements in E-Tech arrived in [[Arcohaem]], the tribe of [[Frigoshia]] quickly protested the changes. Everything: their transportation, government, weapons, culture, and trade would be completely redone! [[Frigoshia]] wanted to retain their traditionalist values, so they resisted and stayed primitive. 

**[[Frigoshia]]**
The Frigoshians are a tribe of warriors. They reject E-Tech and industrialism as something that'll destroy their culture. They're inspired by Mandalorians and Vikings. Visually, they're inspired by the Inuit and they live in Tibetan inspired temples. The men are trained from the age of 8 until 18. They're a stubborn and resistant people. They do not show their faces to outsiders or to opponents as a scare tactic.

**The Republic**
[[The Republic of Arcohaem]] is a diplomatic group of industrialists. They control almost all of [[Arcohaem]] from the capital of Hephaestus. They're visually inspired by Canadian-Victorian Architecture, Brutalism, and Norse-Viking Villages. Led by Chancellor Kaul, they very quickly adopted the changes to maximize profit to help their people to have access to adequate food and supplies instead of the borderline tribal / hunter-gatherer lifestyle they were living.

**Civil War**
The Republic began enforcing the changes in response, constructing a railway into [[Frigoshia]] without their permission. Protests began, which escalated into public violence, which escalated into the execution of the Frigoshian senator for treason. In response, [[Frigoshia]] declared independence and started a civil war against the Republic.

The war has lasted a decade at this point. What the Frigoshians lack in numbers and technology they make up for in sheer skill. They're excellent warriors: jacks of all trades. Plus, they control more territory than any other tribe, and it's all extremely mountainous and unnavigable. When an immovable object meets an unstoppable force, neither resolution can occur. The war drags on for a decade, with the Frigoshians committing countless atrocities to ensure their way of life not only remains in-tact, but becomes dominant.  

In the Republic, a team of experienced specialists exists. They're skilled in infiltration, assassination, acquisition, delivery, and rescue. They're technically known as the 5th Division. You will each be playing as a member of this team, and you'll be receiving your mission in session 1. You're all going to be fairly experienced; you're experienced, but you're not the best of the best or anything.

### PART 3: MAKING A CHARACTER
**Section 1: What You're Gonna Do**
You're going to make a character — don't worry, it’s more fun than it sounds. Your character has a few parts:
- **Personality**
- **Backstory**
- **Class**
- **Background**
- **Species**

You can also give your character custom gear, some money, or even **starting E-Tech** if it makes sense for their story or role.  
Once that’s all done, fill out the form and send it to me. I'll make your guys' character sheets for you unless you want to do it yourself. 

**Section 2: Personality**
Keep it simple. Start with one strong trait or gimmick — like _brave_, _lazy_, _honorable_, _paranoid_, _rebellious_, etc.  
This one word gives you something to hold onto when roleplaying. You can build more layers later as your backstory and choices take shape. Make sure you don't make yourself a lone-wolf or an awful murderous person. Try to be generally good.

**Section 3: Class**
Each class plays differently and focuses on different things. Some are more complex, some are super chill.  
For religious classes (like cleric or paladin), religion isn’t really a thing anymore — so you can re-flavor it! Maybe your character follows a strict code, cultural belief, ancient tech, or something personal.

**Section 4: Species**
Go wild. All species from [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/species) are on the table.  
They’re super varied — pick one that fits the vibe you want, or just looks cool.

**Section 5: Background**
This is what your character was doing **before** joining the team.  
You can choose from things like:
- Acolyte, Artisan, Charlatan, Criminal, Entertainer
- Farmer, Guard, Guide, Hermit, Merchant
- Noble, Sage, Sailor, Scribe, Soldier, Wayfarer
These can give you extra proficiencies, gear, and flavor. Choose one for maximum roleplay.

**Section 6: Backstory & History**
Feel free to **chat in the WhatsApp group or DM each other** to come up with shared history — who knows who, old rivalries, friendships, missions gone wrong, etc.  
Beyond that, your character’s backstory is yours to shape. Go big or small. Just make it interesting. The more detail you put into it the better. Everyone who makes a fully fleshed out character gets an additional proficiency of their choice or a plus 1 to a stat of their choice.

**Section 7: Hit Me Up, Dawg**
Once you’ve got everything ready, fill out the form and let me know what your character's like. That’s how I’ll plan Session 1 and work your stories into the world.

**Section 8: Sending Stuff in the Chat**
