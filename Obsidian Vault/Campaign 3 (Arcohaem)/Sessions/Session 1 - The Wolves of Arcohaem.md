# Pre-Session  
### Plot/Goals  
**In Medias Res**
- Players are introduced
	- All loyal to the Republic.
	- All biased against the Frigoshians.
- In the midst of a mission in the north.
	- They've been working on this mission for a very long time, and this is only the halfway point.
	- They see the worst of [[Frigoshia]], reinforcing the misinformation and biases.
	- They kill a bunch of [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] monsters just like old times.
	- They level up (BECOME LEVEL 11)
	- They get some killer loot.
		- 1 common item
		- 1 uncommon item
		- 1 rare item
		- 1 very rare item
- After the mission is completed, they meet with Commander Kragknull at camp. He's proud of them, but confused by their methods. A group of soldiers got separated from their battalion 2 weeks ago, but they made it back safely. 
- Both Commander Kragknull and the party are being requested in Hephaestus, so they need to travel there immediately. This is shocking to them, since they've been working on this mission for a long time and they're completely abandoning it. It must be important.
- Once they're ready to leave, we flash forwards 1 week to them arriving in Hephaestus. 


**Long Live the Republic**
- Hephaestus
	- Chunky Industrial Era. Cornerstone of the Eathyst market.
	- Gold/marble, military parades, brutalist architecture, extravagant. Trains, gears, smokestacks. Kaul's likeness everywhere.
	- The Republic has a boatload of weapons. Like actually too many weapons and soldiers. Some of them are freaking crazy.
	- Recognition and reputation is culturally important. The Republic has a team of excellent heroes that have gold and marble statues made of them in the city square. They put the party to shame.
	- Propaganda
		- [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] villainism
		- Chancellor Kaul morality w/ the code of Kaul.
		- Chancellor Kaul is a hero, an inspiring leader, and a good man.
		- The Republic is great
		- All of these things will make you happy
		- Kind of Orwellian... not really. 
- Quest
	- Commander Kragknull.
	- A bust of Kaul is stationed in the room.
	- For context: 2 weeks ago Arcohaemian soldiers were separated from their battalion and discovered a secret [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] transport carrying incubation equipment and a white dragon egg. This has led the Senate to believe that the Frigoshians are working on a Dragon breeding program, and they likely have been for awhile. If they already have a substantial number of Dragons, then an invasion could happen any day, and the Republic wouldn't be able to hold out for very long. If they executed a full-scale invasion, they risk leaving the capital vulnerable. So, Chancellor Kaul decided the best course of action would be a quick, efficient strike team.
	- The party has been selected for a top secret mission. Only the party, the Senate, Commander Kragknull, and Chancellor Kaul know about it. Kaul recommended them, the [[PCs - Arcohaem|Wolves of Arcohaem]], specifically. Kragknull thinks it was an odd choice considering their... inconsistent track record. They'd better step up.
	- Their mission has 3 parts. First, they need to infiltrate [[Frigoshia]]. Lies about [[Frigoshia]]. They look, think, and act like beasts. They're brutal, savage, cannibalistic, fascist, and stupid. They're the black and white enemies of the Republic that must be crushed. No one has ever made it past the southern front and lived to tell the tale; expect the worst. You need to be fast, quiet, and ready for a fight.
	- Second, they need to find the dragon breeding program. Due to its importance, it'll most likely be held in a hidden lab within the [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] capital. You'll need to execute light espionage to locate it.
	- Third, you need to destroy it and destroy any remaining dragons. Failure might not mean just losing the war, but destabilizing the entire economy of Serendipita. Without our bulk refineries, the Eathyst trade would be crippled for god knows how long.
	- They're given E-Tech "communicators." They grant
		- You can communicate with anyone else that wears a communicator. While active, you select who you want to be on the other end. If they agree, a com link is established. While in conversation, the person on the other end can hear everything you do. You can have group calls. You can contact Commander Kragknull and Chancellor Kaul (though you shouldn't bother him). You can discreetly communicate with others. Etc. Once installed, you're not to remove or touch them. They also grant a +2 bonus to initiative.
	- They're given "the Code of Kaul." It's a list of 13 basic moral principles that all citizens of the Republic should follow.
	- They're given a map of [[Arcohaem]] and given the opportunity to plan their mission. Where do they go? How do they infiltrate? Do they stock up on supplies anywhere first? Whatever they decide, that'll have to wait until next session.

### Immersive Opening
**In Medias Res**
	Winter of 12c 1266. Northern [[Arcohaem]]. The howling harsh arctic wind burns your exposed flesh. You and your fellow party members have finally found it hidden deep in the frigid Arcohaemian plains: Krothmire. 

**Long Live the Republic**
