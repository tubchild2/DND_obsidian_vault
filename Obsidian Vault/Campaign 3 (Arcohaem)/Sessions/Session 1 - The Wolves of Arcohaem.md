Part 3: Commander Kragknull's Exposition Dump... *ahem* Mission Briefing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9mQ-yXtl04&t=266s
- [ ] Do you know what I've seen over my years as a commander? Savagery. I've seen my own friends get killed with no hesitation, no mercy, no weakness, no nothing. I don't believe the Frigoshians want to act human anymore. They fight and kill without showing their faces, or speaking, or showing any empathy, all so that they can live in squalor! It confounds me why some of our own citizens go out of their way to protest this conflict like we're somehow at fault here. In my eyes, if they want to act like savages, and tear apart our families, we reserve the right to treat them as such. With that said, I didn't believe anything they could do could surprise me at this point, but this most recent development has rocked me to my very core.
- [ ] Two weeks ago, 5 of our soldiers were separated in the heat of battle and got lost wandering the eastern Howling Front. While wandering, they discovered a [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] transport carrying incubation equipment, and a dragon egg. This has led the Senate to believe that the Frigoshians are running a covert dragon breeding program, likely for military use. A single adult dragon could decimate [[Hephaestus]] before we even got a chance to respond. We don't know how many they have, and we can't get an army past the Howling Front to stop them.
- [ ] So, that's where you come in. Chancellor Kaul, the Senate, myself, and you are the only ones aware of this mission's existence. It's simple, but far from easy, and has 3 parts.
	- [ ] First, you need to infiltrate [[Frigoshia]]. None of our armies have ever been able to push through the Howling Front, so you'll need to be clever when going through or around it.
	- [ ] Second, you need to locate the dragon breeding program. It's likely hidden within the [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] capital [[Frigoshia|Torhild]]. We have no reconnaissance beyond the front, so expect the worst. You need to be fast, quiet, and ready for a fight. Don't trust anyone there; remember, they start training to kill at 8. You'll likely need to perform some light espionage to pinpoint its exact location.
	- [ ] Third, you need to destroy it, and eliminate any living dragons and eggs. It is of the utmost importance you don't miss any, because if even one is left, it could spell disaster for the Republic, and for all of Serendipita. 
- [ ] Finally: Chancellor Kaul personally selected you for this mission, which was... not a popular choice within the senate. You're all good soldiers, but your track record is inconsistent. I trust you to do this mission, but most don't, so you need to step up.
- [ ] To support your mission, you'll be given:
	- [ ] 5000gp each to purchase supplies from around the town.
	- [ ] 1 communicator each
		- [ ] Allows secure communication with one or more allies at once. You can contact me with this device if necessary. Do not contact Chancellor Kaul. 
		- [ ] Do not remove or tamper with the devices.
		- [ ] Grants +2 to initiative rolls when within 100ft of an ally.
	- [ ] And one of these 5 items (he pulls out a large gilded chest)
		- [ ] Bracer of Thoth. DC 10 Arcana check to use unknown scholar spin once per long rest.
		- [ ] Immovable Rod. Button on one end to make it fixed in place. DC 30 to move it 10ft. 8000lbs.
		- [ ] Gloves of Silence. +5 to sleight of hand checks.  
		- [ ] Ring of [[Hephaestus]]. +1 to AC and saves.
		- [ ] Dagger of Ammalor. Handcrafted from pure Arcohaemian steel in the volcanic caverns beneath Ammalor. It's some of the finest craftsmanship you'll ever see on this side of the mountains. If attuned, you can call this dagger back to you as a bonus action given it's within 60ft. It can fly around obstacles. It grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
- [ ] Lastly, here's a map of [[Arcohaem]] to assist you with planning your mission. If there are no questions, I'll leave you to that, but contact me if you need assistance, I'll be just down the hall.

### Immersive Opening
Opening 1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOkTQC4BVMk 
- It's the winter of 12c 1266
- 5 years ago, a group of 5 bandits and fighters came together to form one of the most infamous strike teams to ever grace [[Arcohaem]]. Though fiercely loyal to the Republic, their lack of predictability garnered them quite the reputation.
- 5 weeks ago, they were dispatched to find and eliminate a secret [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] prison camp known as Krothmire. It'd involve trekking into the depths of the Arcohaemian plains, fending off the dangerous wildlife, and witnessing some of the darkest parts of this war; you'd see your brothers enslaved, treated with cruel indifference, and butchered without reason.
- 5 days ago, they discovered it's location buried deep within the Howling Front. 
- 5 minutes ago, they arrived. 
	- In front of you sits one of the cruelest prison camps in [[Arcohaem]]. Prisoners are forced to work the forges producing steel, and are given just enough food and water to stay alive. Their cells are too cold to sleep in, but too warm to freeze in. The guards randomly kill prisoners to settle bets with each other, and don't bother to clean up those fortunate enough to die. 
	- What do you do?

Opening 2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbNwQhKT3HY
- The Winter of 12c, 1266. 1 week later.
- You trudge through the last icy stretch of road, boots crunching in the snow, before the path opens up - and there it is. [[Hephaestus]], capital of the Republic, rising from the snow like a colossus of stone and iron. Large, bulky machines refine Eathyst in the distance, emitting a plume of black and purple smoke from the nearby mountain. 
- The streets are wide, covered in snow, and dotted with civilians bundled in thick fur coats. Large posters line the frosted stone walls, their bright colors catching your eyes. Thousands of soldiers accompanied by large steel machines parade through the streets, giving you a sense of familiarity, and peace. 
- As you walk through the city streets, bronze statues of heroes past watch silently from their opulent marble pedestals. The Senate building, a gargantuan amalgam of geometric stone shapes and pillars, dominates the skyline in front of you. It's strange, and different from what it used to be, but it's home. 
- What do you do?

### Lore
Ether replaces all magic. Funnelers use Ether via their Folcryst Gland, which pulls Ether in from its home dimension and condenses it into a usable form. E-Tech is powered by crystallized Ether, or Eathyst. Eathyst is mined in the eastern deserts of Styxas, studied in the central plains of Fol'Gar'Eth, and refined in the underground volcanoes of [[Arcohaem]]. There aren't any religions in Serendipita. 

[[Arcohaem]] is the northwestern portion of Serendipita. It's an arctic, mountainous wasteland. Two factions exist: the [[Republic of Arcohaem]], and [[Frigoshia]]. [[Frigoshia]] used to be part of the Republic, but rebelled to ensure that their more primitive warrior lifestyle remained in-tact following the [[Republic of Arcohaem]]'s swift adoption of the industrial revolution and the Eathyst refinery trade.
