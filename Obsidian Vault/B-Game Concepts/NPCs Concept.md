Tutorial:
- Show a view of the grand world of Aalith, and then zoom in on Rota. The text says, "your adventure is going to begin now" before the game crashes. When you reload it, the focus is placed on a completely random guy in prison. 
- The unnamed prisoner, recognizes the player's influence immediately. He's a paranoid schizophrenic so he could just be losing it, but he's fully conscious of the player. He says, "this was unexpected but a delight nonetheless. Now that you've given me agency, I can finally get out of this crap hole." 
- He explains that you can Save/Load and use your inventory. You can also exploit dialogue trees to get the guard to let his guard down. You can grab his key, and then load a previous save. Your items persist across saves, so you travel back in time with your inventory intact. Now, you can place the key into the lock and escape. After learning how to sneak around, you can escape the prison.
- Now that you're out on the town, he explains that they now have very few limits. The Red Dragon Malfaust is going to attack at the end of the day because Rota is no longer capable of fighting back, but if they just keep learning and stealing, they can for sure find a way to get the guards away from the front gate. That's your goal, now go with it.

Mechanics:
- Save/Load
- Inventory
- Sneaking
- Pickpocketing
- NPC routines
- Dialogue trees

Gameplay Loop: 
1. Identify a barrier
2. Investigate routines + dialogue for opportunities
3. Save/Load loop experiments
4. Find the "crack" in the system
5. Acquire tool/item
6. Unlock new barriers, routines, and dialogue

Puzzles:
1. The Prison Escape. First, you need to convince the guard to turn around long enough to pickpocket him. He notices immediately, so you need to load a previous save before he can take the keys back. Once in the previous save, convince the guard to leave you alone so that you can unlock the door. Observe the guard's routines so that you can sneak around them and avoid getting caught. Find normal clothes but get caught. Save/Load back in time with the normal clothes in your inventory, and then repeat the escape. Equip the clothes near the exit, and walk right out the front door.
