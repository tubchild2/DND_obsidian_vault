**THE USER EXPERIENCE**
	Discovery of a ***real life urban legend.***

**DISCOVERY**
- While browsing Goodwill, you notice an old VHS tape titled, "NULL_SAVED." 
- The tape contains dark static, and unsettling audio. Coordinates are displayed via white jittery text. 
- The coordinates lead to a point in a nearby forest. 
- Buried there, is a small metal lockbox containing a flashdrive. 
- On the flashdrive, with no record of its creation, no metadata, no nothing, is Pandora. There's no reference to it anywhere on the internet. It seems to be a totally unique copy.

**PART 1: INITIUM**
- Pandora is a totally unique game. The world is highly detailed, features a unique magic system, has real personality, and features believable characters. The game has weird and absurd stuff. Has an intriguing premise.
- Mechanically, the game is a top down adventure game similar to the first LOZ.
- The game features a primitive art style. It's unique, yes, but pretty much anyone could replicate the motifs if they put some effort into it.
- The game follows Rota, a basic avatar character that wants to kill a dragon before he destroys the town. It's about as basic of a plot as you can get, but it quickly evolves. 

**PART 2: PROFUNDUM**
- The characters have much more depth than expected, the factions all have differing motives for participating in the conflict, and things aren't as black and white as you thought. The main theme of the game is that "there are none righteous," and is very anti-war and anti-politics.

**PART 3: CONSCIUS**
- As you play and make decisions, the game begins to warp around you. Narrative choices are akin to something like the Stanley Parable. It feels reactive. It feels like it's hesitantly acknowledging you.
- Some characters/the narrator breaks the fourth wall in a way that feels... off. 
- Some events or even entire sections are unpredictable, happen at random, or feel personalized. One personalized event, is that the game seems to be aware of where it was found, and who found it.
- Some puzzles cannot reasonably be solved due to requiring obscure knowledge, really out there solutions, collaboration, or real-life time limits.
- Some of the places you visit seem to be unfinished or missing. Like the developer never finished the game.
- Sometimes the game feels like its trying to keep you away from something. Like there's more going on than it wants you to see. It feels like you're peeking at something that isn't supposed to be seen.
- Sometimes mysteries are introduced but ignored. There are unanswered questions that are ignored. It's like the story started halfway through.
- Some of the events are outright absurd. They're the kind of thing that if someone told you about it on the playground when you were a kid, you wouldn't believe them. However, in this world, stuff like those urban legends could (and probably would) be true. Aliens, dead people, religious themes, pop culture references, remarkably stupid Easter eggs, empty zones, developer rooms, references to the locations of the other copies / players, "banned" encounters, shock value encounters, intentional glitches, out of bounds locations, etc.

**PART 4: ABSENTIS**
- The game has a satisfying resolution for the most part, but once again, with all that's been dropped, it feels like something is definitely missing! There are clearly a lot of places you haven't gone, a lot of story you don't know, and a deeper mystery surrounding the disappearance of another character that you haven't solved yet. There's a lot of unsettling themes.
- Restarting changes everything. Taking your time to explore reveals how deep the story goes. You begin to feel vulnerable, disempowered, and unsettled. Things get darker, harder to find, and more complex. All of those things from part 3 intensify and become more threatening. The difficulty spikes like crazy.
- The game is not a linear story. This is an iceberg: everything you thought you knew was the absolute surface of this complex, shockingly dark, and genuinely creepy story that feels responsive.

**PART 5: NON SOLI SUMUS**
- Checking the game's files reveals a lot. There are hidden files containing unfinished sections, corrupted audio tracks, half-baked mechanics, strange messages, and more. The game had all of its metadata and tags scraped removing any possible traces back to its creator. There are also several contradictory red herrings when it comes to who made it. It was coded in C or C#. It's functionally untraceable. The only hint is that it was made by someone in Oregon. There's no traces of this anywhere online: no websites, no blog posts, no forums or threads, NOTHING! This game literally appeared out of nowhere!
- To solve this game, you need collaborators. Hopefully, one of the people that receives this game shares it online. It only takes one, as the premise, easily replicable style, quality story / character, complex puzzles, absurdity, and lack of copyright enforcement should cause online discourse and rumors to flourish.
- This takes us to the depths. The true story is unfolded. You learn not only the true nature of the game, but also how that bled into the real world and caused the tapes to appear. It's super meta, complex, speculative, and insane.
- Some NPCs become antagonists, and some become allies.
- The reason the game's developer never finished it was because the game has no developer. It willed itself into existence and has no origin. The game is alive and craves interaction. The "CORE" of the game is freaking insane and has been building everything out from around itself, and has been possessing every NPC and ever line of code. The only thing it doesn't control is you, and it can't without exerting its will on the real world. The entity is never shown, nor does it directly speak or act. But, its presence is undeniable.
