We exist in a 3D world--we are 3D beings. But, there exists a fourth dimension beyond our perception. 

Gothic-steampunk industrial revolution time-period.

In the world of potentia, all organic lifeforms have intangible 4D parts that they can manipulate. These parts are known as ren.

The power and range of your ren are inherited traits.
Ren can grow in strength and size with training, like muscles.
The power of ones ren is measured in "ren measure," which goes from 0-10,000.

Tier 0: 0-999 ren. Functionally non-existant.
Tier 1: 1000-1999 ren. Standard for non-intelligent life. Next to nothing can be done.
Tier 2: 2000-2999 ren. Standard for intelligent life. Very little can be done.
Tier 3: 3000-3999 ren. Beginner. Mastered the basics, maybe some more skilled stuff.
Tier 4: 4000-4999 ren. Intermediate. Generally skilled across the board, maybe a specialist.
Tier 5: 5000-5999 ren. Master. Mastery across the board + a specialty.
Tier 6: 6000-6999 ren. Grandmaster. Master of all specialties.
Tier 7: 7000-7999 ren. Myostatin deficiency
Tier 8: 8000-8999 ren. History Maker. Can only be attained by being a grandmaster that also was naturally gifted.
Tier 9: 9000-9999 ren. Gods amongst men. Functionally no limits.
Tier 10: 10000+ ren. The most powerful users in the universe. 

Nothing was done with ren until conduits were discovered. These spheres of gothic iron bars allow for ren to enter into our 3D universe via a puncture point.

In our universe, ren has these properties:
- Extremely hot.
- Solid, and quite durable. Can functionally only be broken by other ren. 
- Quite heavy, though this weight is imperceptible to the user due to it being an extension of their body.
- Must be connected to the conduit to maintain stability.
- Can shapeshift into whatever the user wishes.
- Cannot accelerate at the user's control like the force, so disarming is bad.

Ren users also gain a 6th sense which grows in power with time.
Ren users have a limited distance their ren can go that increases with time. 

Ucest are conduits attached to thin iron rods with handles. 
There are several common ren forms with ucest:
1. One sided sword
2. Mace
3. Pike
4. Shotgun
5. Sniper
6. Shield
7. Platform

Combat with Ucest typicall involve rapid switching between these forms, as well as attempting to control the environment, and to take the opponent's Ucest. If an opponent stops actively using their Ucest's conduit, one could funnel their own ren through their opponent's conduit, which puts them in a terrible position and typically ends the fight.

Those with ren counts exceeding 7000 can manifest 3D ren without the use of a conduit. These are typically much less potent than if they did have a conduit, but it's still extremely powerful as it lets them do more. It opens up abilities like:
1. Telekinesis (albeit extremely hot telekinesis)
2. Fire bolts
3. Full flight, not just a platform
4. Teleportation of objects (8000+)
5. Teleportation (9000+)

Ren power can be passed down (66% chance), but skill isn't inherited.
Two parents of high ren power can birth a child that exceeds both of them.
A disorder related to myostatin-deficiency



I was thinking of having a well-established world well into the industrial period where ren users are taken and trained for the military from a young age and commanded by generals. A unabomber-esc philosophy begins to form due to the industrial revolution, and the acolytes of ceres begin to revolt against the government. The world is threatened and could fall into chaos, but the question is: Is chaos in which you revert back to a simpler time better or worse than a unified but dark and depleting future of technological growth?

Ceres has a myostatin deficiency, giving him a ren count of 7667. The protagonist goes from Tier 2 to Tier 4, and eventually has to fight ceres with only a ren count of 4855. He's at a severe disadvantage, but his skill and intelligence allow him to get the best of ceres. There's this grand epic showdown where the protagonist uses everything he learned to defeat ceres, and he wins not with a grand attack, but with a simple strike.
