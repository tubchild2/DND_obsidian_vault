A game designed to go viral as hell.

### Sound and Video
- Easy to replicate style. Everyone and their grandma could make something that looks like this. 
- Purposefully missing content. Make people think there's something there when there isn't.
### Creation Plan
- Hidden game files containing unfinished sections, corrupted audio tracks, or other half-baked mechanics. 
- Zero comments, tags, or metadata. Cannot be traced back to me.
- Ideally, coded in C or C#. 
- Specifically use hex editors to remove all metadata from the files. 
### Publishing Plan
- ZERO ONLINE TRACES. When searched, nothing will come up. 
- The game, as well as its companion files are loaded onto a drive, and scrubbed of their metadata.
- Ideally, sketchy VHS tapes containing coordinates deep in the woods. You can dig up the game there.
- Alternatively but still good, drop it off at goodwill with no explanation. Anonymously donate it with a bunch of other things so it can't be traced back to you, or place it on the shelves where the cameras can't see you. 

# Design Principles
### Hook and Replayability
The publishing plan, premise, absurdity, and personality encourage people to try it. 
The randomness, 4th wall breaks, personalization, and abundant secrets keep people playing. 
### Collaboration and Virality
The publishing plan combined with the complex lore, mystery, and crazy puzzles pretty much force people to work together. 
The chaotic yet easily replicable style and the absurdity, however, make it extremely easy for rumors to form and spread around the game, driving discourse even further. 
### Untraceable
If I were able to design the game in [[Galactic Standards|C]] from the ground up, and the publishing plan worked, the game couldn't be traced back to me, or to anyone. This creates an instant myth around the game.

# Plot (summary)
- The drive and the game within it were owned by an ex-game developer from Looking Glass. He has paranormal theories, has been stalking people, runs a cult, and is planning to kill someone. He was in his mid 40s in 1998, so he'd be dead by today.
- The drive contains his game, his projects, and his personal affects. It was supposedly donated by someone who inherited it after his death.
