### Lore
**Personality**
- Kind. He has a good sense of morality and wants to help people where possible. 
- Naïve. He always assumes the best, and is too trusting. He's a pushover. People can take advantage with little effort.
- Cowardly. Easily startled, especially around babies, bugs, and caves. Avoids putting himself at risk.
- Detached. Free spirited. Isn't loyal to a flag, doesn't care for politics, focuses more on the individual. Self-sufficient. 

**Quirks**
- Bookish. He enjoys reading and is book-smart.
- Sailor. He enjoys sailing, fishing, and the ocean.
- Bad with Money. He was raised to be self-sufficient, so he's not great at understanding the value of money.

**Backstory**
- **A Family of Merchants.** Ratchet was born aboard his parents brigantine in the *Great Saline Sea*. Ratchet's parents were merchants that would buy and resell regional objects to other kingdoms for a handsome profit. Due to travelling so much, they weren't attached to any kingdom, and spent most of their time on the sea in their brigantine. Their ship (and business) was called the Saline Tide. It was an old weathered ship that had seen better days. It was 3 generations old at this point, meaning it needed frequent repairs.
- **Ma and Pa**. Ratchet's (Garrick Gulliver) father was a stout man who enjoyed fishing and sailing, while his mother (Anna Gulliver) was a free-spirited and curious woman that enjoyed reading and travelling. He picked up an appreciation for all these things from a young age. They made their own fun aboard the ship. They told legends, read books, went fishing, collected trinkets, and played games. It was a simple life. They weren't rich rich by any means, but were mostly self-reliant. 
- **Curious and Well Read.** Due to sailing with his parents, he spent his teen years travelling from manors to monasteries, making deals to access their libraries. He picked up a thing or two, and started tinkering with e-tech as a hobby. He was allowed to explore the towns they stayed in as long as he was careful and came back early. 
- **Davy Jones' Locker.** His parents were going to dock in *Styxas*. While a day's journey off from *Nagoyor Port*, they spotted the black and Jacinth sails of pirates. They attempted to flee, but to the dismay of everyone on board, the Pirates were of a higher caliber than previously thought--they had a Kraken under their command. Its tentacles ripped his parents from the ship and pulled them into the waters below. The Pirates boarded the ship and began emptying it. Ratchet hid in a barrel, and peered through a small hole, where he spotted the captain. It was a horned dragonborn wearing a black leather outfit with a Jacinth eye on it. After returning to their ship the brigantine was smashed clean in two by the Kraken, and Ratchet plummeted into the *Ocean Wide*. Suddenly, he felt a flood of ether surge through him as his Folcryst Gland activated. Using mage hand and mending, he swam above the waves and fashioned a raft.  
- **A New Home**. After floating to shore, he bought himself a small sloop to live out of. It's currently docked in *Nagoyor Port*. His sloop is called the Saline Tide after his parent's brigantine. It's been 6 years since the encounter with the kraken, and he's been exploring Styxas to further his plan.
- **Near Death Experience.** After escaping *The Caves of Demise*, he wandered the *Eastern Desert Vast* with his new band of friends and adventurers. After stumbling into an abandoned sand dwarf city, he encountered a horrifying sight. In front of him stand the corpse of a failed experiment; there sat a 40ft baby riddled with oversized maggots and worms. The swarms of flies overpowered him, and his heart stopped for 30 seconds. If not for some powerful words of assurance from their bard, he would've died. This experience forever changed Ratchet, who suddenly valued his life more than ever. He developed a fear of bugs, babies, and caves. Additionally, he stopped trying to help the people who do the work; he stopped letting himself be vulnerable in combat; he stopped searching for a weapon and became the weapon himself. He'd become a burster!

**Agenda**
1. Gain power
2. Partner with or steal from the Folcrithian
3. Neutralize the kraken
4. Wipe out the pirates that wronged him

**Appearance**

- Brown eyes.
- Blue robe covering his armor
- A belt with all kinds of pouches and tools strapped to it.
- A dagger sheathed on his side
- Medium length messy hair
