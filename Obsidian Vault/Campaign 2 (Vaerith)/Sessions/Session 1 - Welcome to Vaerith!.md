1. Brief Monologue to set the scene, and to introduce the campaign.
2. Set the scene
3. Each party member gets to introduce themselves in universe.

Do a broad description of [[Vaerith]], before honing in on [[Lunfall]].
Out adventure won't begin in [[Lunfall]]. It might not even come up, because this isn't the story of [[Vaerith]], this is the story of a handful of strangers who wandered into a small town smack dab in the middle of [[Elythra]].


*Draft 1:*
They are all in the plains of [[Elythra]], staying at a small town. They all meet on the day of a big festival. They make friends with a kind NPC boy, and the friendly townsfolk. They notice some shady dealings going on, and the mayor doesn't show up for his speech. Suddenly, the festival is interrupted by a small band of Aasimar soldiers, led by a field marshal and his mount. The town is in danger, and they're pushed to stay and fight, or run and hide. The NPC boy is in danger. The [[Province of Seraephin]] is after their Literography library, since they believe it contains fragments of an incredibly artifact.
- If they fight and win, they are praised by the townsfolk and treated as heroes. They become wanted by the [[Province of Seraephin]]. 
- If they fight and lose, the town is conquered and they get captured by the Aasimar.
- If they successfully escape, the town is conquered, but they make it out with their lives. They become wanted by the [[Province of Seraephin]]. 
- If they unsuccessfully escape, the town burns down and they're captured by the Aasimar.

*Draft 3:*
- Make [[Eterology]] in an aspect of Arbiter's Rest culture. Give it a distinct theme with a visual component. Gameplay first. Fill your cities with cool themed experiences that appeal to your players (not all shops). Don't worry too much about details or realism. If things aren't going to relate to gameplay, don't worry about them!
- Give players a plot hook, an emotional hook, and a financial hook
- Team building exercises. Put your characters in close-quarters dangerous situations.
- Weave their backstories into the main plot of the campaign.
- Give the players what they want.
- The plot hook shouldn't involve the Aasimar, or any other world power. It should be localized! They should feel like they're living in the world, and not like the world is revolving around them.
