2. Set the scene
3. Each party member gets to introduce themselves in universe.

Do a broad description of Vaerith, before honing in on Lunfall.
Out adventure won't begin in Lunfall. It might not even come up, because this isn't the story of Vaerith, this is the story of a handful of strangers who wandered into a small town smack dab in the middle of Elythra.



Plot Hook: They are all in the plains of Elythra, staying at a small town. They all meet on the day of a big festival. They make friends with a kind NPC boy, and the friendly townsfolk. They notice some shady dealings going on, and the mayor doesn't show up for his speech. Suddenly, the festival is interrupted by a small band of Aasimar soldiers, led by a field marshal and his mount. The town is in danger, and they're pushed to stay and fight, or run and hide. The NPC boy is in danger. The Province of Seraephin is after their Literography library, since they believe it contains fragments of an incredibly artifact.


If they fight and win, they are praised by the townsfolk and treated as heroes. They become wanted by the [[Province of Seraephin]]. 

If they fight and lose, the town is conquered and they get captured by the Aasimar.

If they successfully escape, the town is conquered, but they make it out with their lives. They become wanted by the [[Province of Seraephin]]. 

If they unsuccessfully escape, the town burns down and they're captured by the Aasimar.
