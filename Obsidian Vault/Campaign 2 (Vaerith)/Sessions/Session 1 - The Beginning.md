# Session #1, New Beginnings (~2-3 Hours)
### Part 1
[[Vaerith]]'s Introduction (~2min)
- Describe the landscape of [[Vaerith]]
- Mention that [[The Eye of Seraephin|the moon]] has a gigantic hole in it.
- Describe [[Arbiter's Rest]]
- Describe the festival
- Use subtext for the Aasimar conflict
- Use subtext for the current technological level
- Use subtext for the tone (adventurous)

[[PCs Vaerith|Azrael]] and [[PCs Vaerith|Maje]]'s Introduction (~4min)
- At a small shop in the outer edges of the city. Aethotics isn't practiced too commonly.
- [[PCs Vaerith|Maje]] is upstairs, sleeping. It's early; it's a new day, the sun is shining, the wind is blowing, and birds are chirping. [[PCs Vaerith|Maje]] doesn't remember too much from his childhood; he was found in a race-bike and raised by the mechanics of a local shop. He's lived there since in a make-shift bedroom in the attic. His peaceful slumber is quickly interrupted by the sound of the door opening, followed by a series of loud bangs and thuds.
- [[PCs Vaerith|Azrael]] collapses downstairs, exhausted after travelling several miles with little food or water. His lieutenant and his fellow privates were just attacked for desertion; he doesn't know who else (if anyone) survived. He's completely wiped.
[[PCs Vaerith|Dhrakz]] and [[PCs Vaerith|Rhulk]]'s Introduction (~4min) 
- In a tavern closer to the center of the city.
- An [[Ashkara]] sits at the bar. He looks stern, and like he's seen some things. [[Ashkara]] are typically found in the desert, so [[PCs Vaerith|Dhrakz]] is a peculiar sight to behold.
- But, wait, there's someone else here. In the far back corner of the tavern sits a dark, almost imperceptible entity. It looks human, but it's a mass of twirling smoke and dust forming a body. The [[Umbra]] are a rare, almost nonexistent race. Very few even know they exist, so [[PCs Vaerith|Rhulk]]'s presence adds an heir of mystery to the tavern. You'd think a creature like this would be above fear, but to our surprise, he seems on edge about something that just happened to him outside.
- [[PCs Vaerith|Dhrakz]] notices [[PCs Vaerith|Rhulk]].
[[PCs Vaerith|Pavement]] and [[PCs Vaerith|Samkin]]'s Introduction (~4min)
- In a small forest on the edges of the town
- A mushroom man walks confidently through the woods, despite having no eyes. Then, he stops, somehow navigating around a series of complex obstacles. [[PCs Vaerith|Pavement]] pauses, sensing something, potentially another client in the trees above.
- [[PCs Vaerith|Samkin]] drops from the trees above, realizing that he'd been detected. He's a 6ft squirrel, a sight that'd be terrifying anywhere but in [[Vaerith]]. 

Bringing Together the Party
- There's a festival in [[Arbiter's rest]]. People are gathering there, and everyone feels compelled to travel there.
- They have time to do whatever they want to at the festival.
	- Show, don't tell the world here
- Dhrakz and Pavement meet a super kindhearted na√Øve and bold child named Kenny. He's super impressed by everything they do and wants to be just like them. He calls them his best friends. His dad is off fighting in the war so he's the man of the house. His mom is a sweet but obviously very exhausted woman.
### Part 2
The Threat
- While at the festival, Kenny gets lured off by himself. 
- Kenny is ambushed by a group of mud and dust mephits that kidnap him and begin flying off with him. They take him towards Helmhorn Forest, to the south of the town, across the lake. 
- Kenny's mom sees him being taken away and lets out a blood curdling scream, which quiets the festival.
- She runs into town screaming that her sun has been taken and for someone to please help.
	- (hopefully) the party volunteers
		- Azrael, Maje, Rhulk, and Samkin out of common decency
		- Dhrakz and Pavement out of peer pressure or from knowing Kenny personally

Crossing the Lake

Moving through Helmhorn

### Part 3
The Gate
- They arrive at a nice, almost suburban, house in the forest. It's front gate is guarded by dust and mud mephits which are polluting and laughing historically dead animals. "Hahahaha! . . . You're my best friend muddy."
- They can jump them, sneak around them, or confront them verbally.
The House
- As they enter, they see a bunch of ads for motorcycles from Maje's shop, hair growth products, photos of celebrity women, a rabbit pen, opened old cups of yogurt, grog bottles, and other things like that. This is a single man in his late 40s, maybe 50s.
- They hear noises coming from the basement. Moving down, they enter a large laboratory but don't see anyone. They see Kenny in a comically large prison that was dug into the wall to the right.
- Suddenly, they're ambushed by a 2ft tall man wearing jeans, a wife beater, and a cape. He's got a long grey beard and is wearing large glasses. His hairline is receding, and he's got very large red cheeks. He's an amateur eterologist with a bag of holding, giving him access to a slew of ether items.
- Once on low health, he'll pull out a comically large shotgun and attempt to fire it at the party. He'll completely miss, causing him to launch himself backwards into the wall, before face planting on the ground.
- He'll give up and surrender. He says he's sorry and says he'll give them each something of value to spare him.
- If questioned as to why he stole Kenny, he sadly says, "I just wanted to be young again. :(. I thought I could use him as an eterological programming device to convert me into a young man again."
- He gives everyone something of value:
	- He gives Maje a map to a cache that supposedly contains part of the DM-77, he never finished deciphering it. He just wanted a motorcycle to make him cool again.
	- He gives [[PCs Vaerith|Rhulk]] a 6-pack of healing potions that he bought. They look like beer cans.
	- He gives [[PCs Vaerith|Pavement]] 
	- He gives [[PCs Vaerith|Samkin]] 
	- He gives [[PCs Vaerith|Azrael]] the "mark of the hero" it's a business card he got from a restaurant that confirms that the owner is indeed really cool and good and no one can deny it.
	- He gives [[PCs Vaerith|Dhrakz]]
