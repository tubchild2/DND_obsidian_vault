# Pre-Session
## Plot/Goals  
Part 1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3B802PIuB0
[[Arbiter's Rest]] is in danger from an invasion of Magma Mephits the party inadvertently sent. 
- They've almost breached the outer wall and have engulfed the nearby trees and farms in flames. 
- Guards are helping to fend them off, but there's quite a few of them. 
- Some loot is scattered around the battlefield.

Part 2

The festival ended early and everyone went home to hide. The streets are back to mostly quiet, aside from fearless people, refugees, and guards. Stone medieval architecture, train tracks. Industrial era. Blue and gold flag of the republic.
	- A group of elven (wood elf) refugees has arrived on the train. They're from Yoata falls, the victim of a recent Aasimar raid.
	- [[PCs--Vaerith|Maje]] spots a refugee that needs help but doesn't want it.
	- A refugee talks about how pollution from the war has ruined their fishing business in Mistfall. 
	- A refugee needs weapons and tools but is too poor to afford them. [[PCs--Vaerith|Pavement]] nudge nudge.

Part 3

Senator Walsh invites them to come to his home that night for a meal to thank them for defending the town. 
	- He challenges [[PCs--Vaerith|Dhrakz]]' views.
	- He praises [[PCs--Vaerith|Azrael]]'s turn to good. A servant sweeping in the back glances up at [[PCs--Vaerith|Azrael]].
	- He speaks about [[Ceres]]. How he was born with hyperathemia and quickly surpassed his teachers in skill. It doesn't make sense. If that's true, why wouldn't he just end the war himself? Unless he still wants something. Either way, he holds all of the cards.
	- He invited them for selfish reasons. He wants them to help in the war effort to turn the tide. He saw them fighting and believe that a group like them has the potential to help turn the tide in the conflict. Wherever they go next, he hopes they do it with some kind of plan for putting their skills to use.
	- He gives them a map of [[Elythra]]. Walsh asks where they plan to head next, and he offers some supplies to help them on their journey.
	- He remembers something and says he needs to go to his office but they can think about it.
[[PCs--Vaerith|Azrael]] is attacked while separated by a servant whose brother was killed in a raid.

## Immersive Opening
[[PCs--Vaerith|Azrael]], [[PCs--Vaerith|Maje]] climb up out of the caves having finally caught up with the rest of the group. From atop the misty peak of Barrel Hill, the unpleasant stench of smoke begins to waft into your nostrils. Over rolling hills, in the distance, you see a plumes of smoke, and hear the sound of screaming. The snapping of burning wood echoes in the distance over the impacts of arrows. You hear the horn of a train approaching [[Arbiter's Rest]] from the north, no doubt carrying civilians to the festival. A group of Magma Mephits has attacked the Festival and has begun burning down the town. What do you do?
