 **DISABLE REPEAT** https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1efrs3nViWBMM69bteEzUP?si=02505b838da946dc&pt=8874a49f04fac5fa8cacaaac4e442527
- Welcome back, and welcome to [[Vaerith]].
- We pan from the southern tip of the island, across scorched red rock mountains and wind-carved deserts. It's a quiet, cool morning. Above, the broken moon hangs--shattered like a porcelain plate, missing a large portion of its mass. The stars around it fade as the first light of morning pushes up over the horizon.
- We drift down through the soft clouds into a lush range of emerald hills and valleys. Winged raccoons flutter through the trees, and large vultures swoop down from the peaks of the cliff-ridden hills. Below us: a lake like glass, nestled in the heart of [[Arbiter's Rest]]. 
- There are no Aasimar airships, no silver trails of exhaust, no anxieties of any kind; today is the Festival of the Arbiter, and it's going to be a good day. It's dawn, it's peaceful, and it's quiet.

### [[PCs - Vaerith|Azrael]] and [[PCs - Vaerith|Maje]]

- As [[Seraephin|the sun]] peaks above the hills, we pan over to a small workshop on the outskirts of the town--a quiet place filled with strange brass piping, cooling coils, and the soft hum of ether machinery. We rise into the attic, where a small cardboard box lined with scrap blankets and patchwork pillows rests in the corner. Curled up inside is **[[PCs - Vaerith|Maje]]**, a small Jerbeen, breathing slow and deep, still tangled in sleep.
- Then, THUD!
- Something downstairs lands, something heavy. [[PCs - Vaerith|Maje]]'s eyes snap open, filled with anxiety. You know that feeling you get when you're home alone, and you see a door closed with the light on? Or when you get home after a long day and notice something has moved without your knowledge? It's not a thought, it's more primal than that. It's an awareness. You can feel someone there, just out of sight. It's instinct: primal anxiety. With no evidence, no reason, no logic, you feels that there's someone, or something, downstairs. Something tall. Maybe too tall. Something that moved wrong—**fast**, confident, like it didn’t care about being noticed.
- What do you do?
	- (investigating) Creeping down the attic stairs of the desolate workshop, you're pleasantly surprised, but still anxious. Collapsed, exhausted apparently from running, is an Aasimar in full military gear. Except, there's a notable issue, the insignia of his people has appears to have been burnt off intentionally. Whoever he is, he's noticed you and he's awake.
- The sound of music from outside alerts you that the festival seems to be starting.

### [[PCs - Vaerith|Rhulk]] and [[PCs - Vaerith|Dhrakz]]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv3Nl-Od9YU
- We pan into the inner city. The early morning light creeps through the grimy windows of the Lockmane Inn. The tavern is nearly empty--just a few stragglers nursing last night's regrets.
- [[PCs - Vaerith|Dhrakz]] sits at the bar, tall and imposing, clad in worn paladin armor layered beneath dusty desert robes. The black scorpion exoskeleton of his face is mostly covered by his face-mask--a relic passed down through generations, concealing a face hardened by war. He drains the last of a dry desert whisky, the bitterness matching the weight of his exile.
- In the shadows of the tavern, barely more than a whisper in the tavern's morning quiet, a figure stirs--a fragile wisp of black smoke and dust, forming a body wearing a brown cloak. [[PCs - Vaerith|Rhulk]], an [[Umbra]], far from the safety of his ancient [[underdark]] home, afraid and utterly out of place.
- What do you do?
	- (not roleplaying or doing anything to interact with one another) Suddenly, while mixing a drink, the barkeep knocks over few bottles, which smash and roll all over the ground. The barkeep goes, "Gotdang *mumbles*!" One of the bottles rolls over to [[PCs - Vaerith|Rhulk]], which catches the barkeep's attention. "You! I read about one of yous once, you've got them mind powers don't you! You messin with my shop to get a free drink? Yous just like that thing that fought that kid a week ago! What do yous have to say for yourself?"
- The sound of music from outside alerts you that the festival seems to be starting.

### [[PCs - Vaerith|Pavement]] and [[PCs - Vaerith|Samkin]]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29XymHesxa0&t=4s
- Moving away from the tavern, we pan to the east of the town to a small forest known as Kestrel Weald. The trees sway softly in the breeze, and a small river connecting to Lake Helmhorn babbles quietly in the morning light. [[PCs - Vaerith|Samkin]] sits patiently--his feet dangling off a short mossy stone bridge. He's fishing, one of his favorite pastimes, and from the looks of it, he's been there for quite some time. [[PCs - Vaerith|Samkin]] is a 6ft tall squirrel, which would be quite a disturbing image anywhere but [[Vaerith]]. 
- Evidently travelling a similar path, a dense [[Mushi]] named [[PCs - Vaerith|Pavement]] approaches one end of the bridge. [[PCs - Vaerith|Pavement]] appears as a tall, somewhat stocky merchant, carrying a pack of supplies, likely to sell them at today's festival. They both notice each other, albeit briefly. 
- What do you do?
- The sound of music from outside alerts you that the festival seems to be starting.

#### The Festival
Ambience: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/18xU3abMkmvpUbvn4dkrE1?si=4cf4657ad70149b3&pt=e6d14489cce710d7ed82c47c0b1d2ee1
- You all begin to hear music coming from the center of the town. It seems like the festival is starting.
- (entering the festival)
	- Walking into town, the early morning light piercing through balloons and floats, you see crowds of hundreds of people gathered into the town square. There aren't many guards, [[Seraephin|the sun]] is shining, and the sound of cheering fills your ears. Streamers, balloons, market stalls, trinkets, fried fish, candy, fake relics, kids.
	- There are so many things to do, so many things to see; there's shows, there's dancing, there's merchants of food, weapons, materials, spices, tools, books, fishing rods, and more!
	- Looking around the square, you spot wanted posters, a boy in a wheelchair, a bunch of rocks that aren't as cool as [[PCs - Vaerith|Rhulk]]'s, and a chubby raccoon with wings doing something in a nearby alleyway. 

The Vulture
- As [[PCs - Vaerith|Rhulk]] walks throughout the town, he spots a large vulture-like bird landing on nearby poles. It suddenly looks directly at [[PCs - Vaerith|Rhulk]], and says, "Your rock isn't even that cool and no one else likes it. I think it's stupid."

The Wanted Posters
- A giant vulture is wanted for 26 counts of theft. Currently valued at 520 gold pieces worth of loot. 
- Middle aged divorcee is wanted for child endangerment, attempted kidnapping, illegal eterological practice,  public intoxication, public urination, public defecation, public depression, and resisting law enforcement. 
- A shapeshifting creature named "uugghhgllkgh" is wanted for breaking and entering, kidnapping, attempted murder, and a criminal inability to defend oneself. 
- A homeless man named "Zezir" is wanted for 2 counts of attempted murder, animal endangerment, production, possession, and distribution of illegal substances, and for being really gross looking. 

The Boy in the Wheelchair
- He's being pushed around by his mother. He's a naïve, brave, and insecure kid who wants to prove that he's a man ever since his dad left. Him and his mom fought and killed a shapeshifting creature, a homeless man, and a bunch of raccoons. Life has really hit them hard recently.

Chubby Raccoon
- There's a fat racoon with wings frantically searching for meth. The only source seems to have been

Preaching:
- Rejected by someone who learns he's an Aasimar

Sales:
- He makes a couple sales!

### The Freaking Bird
- [[PCs - Vaerith|Rhulk]], could you make a strength saving throw with disadvantage please? (DC18)
- https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4lxG66UpN5kvpT3rOoCDJI?si=49aadb938d46436c&pt=8838271bae4720a8bd633b9705c5e7d1
- Suddenly, the vulture swoops down from the skies above and pulls [[PCs - Vaerith|Rhulk]]'s rock clean from his gaseous fingers before fluttering up into the wind. After seeing this, the townsfolk erupt in anger and start throwing anything and everything they can at the vulture--rocks and bottles and rakes and foods and anything else they can get their hands on! One kid screams at the top of his lungs, "GOD DANG VULTURE--BRING BACK MY DAD!" as he hucks a stone.
- In this commotion, [[PCs - Vaerith|Azrael]], [[PCs - Vaerith|Maje]], [[PCs - Vaerith|Dhrakz]], [[PCs - Vaerith|Pavement]], and [[PCs - Vaerith|Samkin]] all notice [[PCs - Vaerith|Rhulk]]. The Vulture is moving swiftly west with [[PCs - Vaerith|Rhulk]]'s most prized possession, what do you do?
- (pursuit)
	- The vulture flies through town, soaring over a balcony and around buildings. 
	- The vulture exits the western perimeter of the town and begins flying towards the cliffs of Barrel Hill. 
	- The vulture soars above the cliffside and lands.
	- As you approach the cliffside, you notice a small camp. There used to be an active set of mines here, and chances are, entering the small opening in the cliff could get you passage to the surface. However, strangely, a fire seems to be emanating from what should've been a long abandoned mineshaft.

NOTE: If they catch the vulture and return to town, the townsfolk will ask if they brought anything else back, and then ask them to. "MY DAD IS STILL OUT THERE MAN COME ON!"

### The Mines of Helmhorn
Entry:
- You enter the passage on the side of the hill. It's partially collapsing, forcing you to carefully walk on sets of rails extending over pits deeper than you can see. After a minute or two, you arrive in a spacious, hand-carved room with a lit brazier in the center of it dangling over a deep pit. The orange, clay-like rocks spit up dust as you walk. Four sets of rails run from the four edges of the room to their opposites, extending into large caverns you can't fully see. On the other side of the room is the path to the surface. 
- As you enter, you spot 2 mud mephits, and 2 magma mephits. They haven't noticed you yet, as they're too busy playing with a minecart full of garbage. The sounds of rolling minecarts from the east side of the room thunders, and eventually a cart comes hurling by.
- Roll initiative!

### The Surface
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNN7iTA57jM
- Continuing through the vault door, you arrive at a spiral staircase that leads to the surface, and thus, to the nest of the Vulture. It's nest is up in a tree, but below its nest is a massive pile of gold and random trinkets. There's also a middle aged man who's asleep in all the gold. 
- It's asleep in its nest. It hasn't noticed you. 
- What do you do?
