Born with hyperathemia, making him naturally powerful.

He has a sister named Opal. She's a super sweet and heroic lady. She has hyperathemia, but is a cleric.

Ceres had a bad experience with the religious code of the Church of Seraephin. Became disillusioned with traditional morality as nothing more arbitrary guidelines that don't always work or apply to every situation. Life isn't black and white, and guidelines like these portray it as such.

Enrolled in the Lunfall academy of Eterology and quickly surpassed his instructors in skill. 

His family lost absolutely everything they had. He internalized some beliefs about the state of the world. He believed it to be severely, and ultimately flawed. Nothing can possibly fix it, because it's inherently bad--you cannot polish a turd. If nothing, not work, nor family, nor morality have any guidelines on your actual impact in the world, then it's best to just try to fully experience and enjoy life now.

Mastered Eterology at 18 years old.

Took an interest in painting. The romantic and artistic ideal that vivid experiences, strong emotions, and memorable actions are what matter.

His parents passed away when he was 25. He had a falling out with his sister over what to do next, causing her to move away from Lunfall.

Got into legal trouble and was secretly freed by the Order of Lunalia when he was 18. They indoctrinated him, fed him their lies, showed him their forbidden ether abilities, and promised him real change. Ceres disappeared and focused entirely on his studies.

Was radicalized. He believes the Umbra and the Aasimar are higher beings, and that the greatest impact he could have on the world while pursuing pleasure is wiping out all other inferior species. He'd satisfy his bloodlust, and help to bring about the return of Lunalia. 

Ceres led the charge in the Order's grand plan to overthrow the Province of Seraephin. He became the face of a fascist regime that quickly overturned the government. After acquiring the Ring of Seraephin, He became easily one of the most dominating and powerful eterologists to ever walk the planet.

The single most powerful ether user in history. He is truly a god amongst men and should not be trifled with. Everything from his genetics, to his equipment, to his training, to his mentality, was perfected. He commands the largest, most powerful, most technologically advanced army in [[Vaerith]]. When picking who to go to war with, he chose everyone and is winning. Just being within a mile of him causes anxiety and dread. Fear him.

His only weakness is his sister. He cannot find her. Their falling out still haunts him to this day.
