The Moon is an organic creature of unknown origin. It's extremely ether potent, and is currently asleep. It's supposedly been "asleep" since ~66,000,000 BCE, when its "iris" ([[Moonwrought]]) fell to Earth. 

It made frequent use of telekinesis and singularities to accomplish its will. It's "angels" are high level [[Umbra]], and they are terrifyingly powerful. The [[Umbra]] residing on the moon were put to sleep, and have been dormant ever since.
