The Moon is an organic creature of unknown origin. It's extremely ether potent, and is currently asleep. It's supposedly been "asleep" since ~66,000,000 BCE, when its "iris" ([[Moonwrought]]) fell to Earth. 

It made frequent use of telekinesis and singularities to accomplish its will. It's "angels" are high level [[Umbra]], and they are terrifyingly powerful. The [[Umbra]] residing on the moon were put to sleep, and have been dormant ever since. 

Lunalia requires immense power to be reawakened. Likely requiring the power of 100 unified, powerful ether users all working collectively, or two fully charged rings (See [[The Ring of Seraephin and the Ring of Lunalia|Ring of Lunalia]] and [[The Ring of Seraephin and the Ring of Lunalia|Ring of Seraephin]]).

Worshipped by the [[Order of Lunalia]]
