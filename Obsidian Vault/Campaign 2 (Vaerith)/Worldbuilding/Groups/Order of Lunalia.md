![[The Order of Lunalia.jpg]]


A cult of moon worshipping fanatics dating back to ~1265 BCE. They're the counterpart to the [[Province of Seraephin]].

They contain the second half of the original Testament of [[Lunfall]], called the "Forbidden Testament of [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]]." It contains details about the true nature of the universe, what the sun and moon are, and how they work. However, it contains faulty wisdom incentivizing power and aggression.

Beliefs:
Sources:
- The following information was communicated to the ancient Aasimar by a post-creation Aasimar progenitor in roughly 1265 BCE. He was the only Aasimar to blink into existence without being created or without being birthed.
Reality:
- The universe is a shared dream. Each participant contains the ability to shape the world around them. This manifests as Ether. Consequently, the laws of nature are flexible.
- Most sentient beings are born from inheritance, but it wasn't always that way. "Progenitors" blink into existence from nothing, and are typically the first few members of their species. They carry knowledge of what came before, and are much more ether potent for it. 
- The dream began in 150,000,000 BCE when an unknown entity known only as "the primordial" first blinked into existence. There's no way of knowing what the primordial was, but it would've had to have existed at some point due to the laws of nature.
[[Seraephin]] and [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]]
- The sun and moon are ancient and powerful progenitors that formed when the dream began. 
- The sun's name is [[Seraephin]], and [[The Eye of Seraephin|the moon]]'s name is [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]]. They are not gods, just powerful progenitors.
- The sun and moon both contain and organic center that contains their bodies. Everything else is a mere shell of [[bionite]] to contain their true power.
- [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]] craves power and chaos, and [[Seraephin]] loves life and order. [[Seraephin]] is more benevolent and isn't that active. It's not really reliable. [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]] is very different and wants to enforce its will on [[Vaerith]].
- [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]] created the [[Umbra]], and [[Seraephin]] created the Aasimar. These two species are the only two to be created.
The Creation of [[Lunfall]]
- [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]] shattered itself to wipe out all life on earth. It hurled a large chunk of its shell to [[Vaerith]] named [[Moonwrought]]. This exhausted it, causing it to fall into a deep sleep for the past 66 million years. The [[Umbra]] arrived on [[Moonwrought]].
- [[Seraephin]] created Aasimar on [[Vaerith]] once life mostly reformed in 4000 BCE to counteract whatever [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]] was planning.
Awakening
- [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]] can be woken up, but it requires an extremely powerful energy source: likely all of [[Moonwrought]].
Morality and Worship:
- [[Seraephin]] is lazy, and doesn't really care. While just as important as [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]], it doesn't deserve as much reverence.
- [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]] provides the path to power
- They need to reawaken [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]] to gain true power.
- All species besides the [[Umbra]] and the Aasimar are impure and don't deserve life.

### Poem from the Order of Lunalia
We recalled the days long passed
When stars formed of formless vast

We saw God-moon, oh great guide
Not idle, dissatisfied

We, twin-born of Sun and Moon
Abound in hate, and never one

We saw you there, dim of life
The spilled blood of dark and light

We toiled without her sight
The twin rings of dark and light

We sought to end the endless strife
But the ring's thieves stayed their life

We cannot give in, God-moon
Taunt the tired God of noon

We, ire of Lunalia
Which wrath wrought our blackened skies

We chant with flies beneath
"Wake the god that fell asleep"

We seek return, the dream anew
The simpler world, the firstborn gnu

We scour and search for him
Bear the rings, whisper the hymn

And when the bearer wakes the eye
Man will burn, but we'll survive
