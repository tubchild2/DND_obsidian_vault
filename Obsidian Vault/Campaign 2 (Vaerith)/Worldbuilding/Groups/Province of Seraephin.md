### The Testament of [[Lunfall]] (the Religion of the Aasimar)
**The Nature of the Universe:**
-        The world was created by Seraephin (the sun) long ago
-        [[The Eye of Seraephin|The moon]] is Seraephin’s eye.
-        The meteor that created [[Lunfall]] ([[Moonwrought]]) is Seraephin’s iris and is the reason [[The Eye of Seraephin|the moon]] has a giant hole in it. They believe the giant pillar in the center of [[Lunfall]] is [[Moonwrought]].
-        The stars are Seraephin’s followers after they die.
-        The day is for Seraephin to enact his power, while the night is for deliberation and observance.

**Core Beliefs:**
-        The Aasimar are divinely chosen and descended from the Sun.
-        Ether comes from the connection to [[Moonwrought]], and thus to Seraephin. To use it is to worship.
-        The Aasimar are stronger together. Community is important, and you should, therefore, love your nation.
-        If you are an official member of the religion, you can’t drink or marry.  
-        Be loving and peaceable to your neighbors.
-        Prayer to Seraephin is more effective during the night.  

**Wartime DLC Beliefs:**
-        King Ceres is a prophet. He was chosen to lead the people to salvation by Seraephin himself. He is the wisest and strongest Aasimar to ever live.  
-        To serve King Ceres is to worship. To fail to serve—either by defiance or through inability—is blasphemy of the highest order.
-        No other nation has a superior form of government, as they are part of the “old order.” This “old order” suppressed and victimized the Aasimar for millennia.
-        The Aasimar are more than just divinely chosen, they’re absolutely superior genetically, intellectually, and culturally.
-        To survive is to struggle; violence in behalf of the Province is a symbol of their divine right to domination and is an act of providence.

**The History of the Aasimar**
**~1265 BCE**
- The ancient Aasimar complete the Testament of [[Lunfall]].

**~1100 CE**
- The Aasimar organize into a single nation—the Province of Seraephin

**1739**
- Prince Gulliver becomes the new King of the Province, despite being an idiot. He escalates a conflict between the High Elves (Vivek) and the Rock Gnomes (Yavhrim) and permanently ruins their centuries long peaceful relationship. His mismanagement of the situation escalates to a declaration of war. Countless citizens die during the conflict.
- King Gulliver surrenders, making the entire nation look terrible in the process. Almost everyone hates the King and feels hopeless, but no one can kill him due to the Kings of the Aasimar bearing some kind of weapon that’s not disclosed to the public.
- The Province enters a downward spiral and the economy plummets. They have to pay back Vivek and Yavhrim for the unnecessary damages.
- A man named Ceres begins speaking in the public square of [[Thesk]]. He’s charismatic, intimidating, and personal. He touts himself as a messianic figure sent by Seraephin. He’s a poor, working-class Aasimar that’s extremely nationalistic but hates the King. He preaches that they are stronger together, and denounces everything except the Province.
-  Ceres’ protests become more aggressive as he rallies more supporters. By speaking to large crowds, he doesn’t have to worry about making that good of an argument. He leverages the religion to convince the populace that the Aasimar are superior technologically and genetically due to “descending from God.” He believes they should have authority over the other nations.
- Law enforcement attempts to control the protests, but the crowds are too charged to be stopped. Ceres makes a public display of his Eterological abilities by taking 13 soldiers at once. This only furthered his claims of divine importance. People began to worship him.

**1740**
- The revolts become violent enough to give Ceres the opportunity to organize and carry out a full-scale rebellion. He storms the Palace of Wings in [[Thesk]] (the capital) and fights King Gulliver. Despite whatever weapon the King had, Ceres killed him and seized the throne for himself.
- Ceres immediately overthrows the government and begins instituting a series of radical changes under the guise of rebirthing the nation. He tears down everything from the old order and splits his new government into 7 wings to brutally enforce his regime. Anyone who doesn’t submit the new order is executed publicly.
- Ceres distributes emotion-fueled propaganda. There’s an emphasis on aesthetics, with nationalistic and religious symbols. Everything is over-the-top, and nationalism is pushed to its absolute extreme. Ceres even inserts himself into the religion, canonizing myths about him bearing the wisdom and power of 10000 men.
- The Province’s peaceful relationship with all other nations is completely ruined, as they now believe the rest of the world to be inferior, contradictory, and weak. They don’t share the enlightened form of government that the Aasimar do—the Province was reborn into something superior!
- Through preaching of Darwinian morals, Ceres convinces the public that struggle, and bloodshed isn’t just good, it’s necessary to assert survival. Public violence is especially popular. Consequently, people who can’t offer anything (disabled, weak, etc.) are either enslaved or executed.

**1741**
- Ceres begins producing massive armies to publicly display the Province’s strength. It’s also around this time that Aethotics skyrockets due to the development of their mysterious new ether power source “[[Bionite]].”  It’s origins and properties are kept secret, but whatever it is, it’s extremely dangerous. Additionally, the steam engine was discovered this year, granting them an immense technological boost.

**1746**
- The Province launches a deadly first strike; they immediately dominate the [[High Forest]], wiping out Vivek and Yavhrim, forcing the native High Elves and Rock Gnomes to flee. Their air powered vehicles meant they could attack anywhere, anytime. However, to their dismay, the nations of [[Vaerith]] collectively resisted, putting the war at a standstill.

**1768**
- After 22 years of violence, no progress can be made by the Province, or by the nations of [[Vaerith]]. The vast number of opponents the Province has balances out their overwhelming power advantage. The fact is, as long as the nations of [[Vaerith]] are working together, the Province can’t win.

### Culture of the Province
**Art and Aesthetics**
-        Common arts include the symphony, theater, sculpture, and painting. More of an emphasis on high art.
-        Ceres’ regime uses eyes, wings, heads, children, rings, books, and bows as common symbols.
-        The architecture is like dark academia + steampunk + old New York. They make frequent usage of towers, gardens, libraries, relief sculptures, grand windows, and airships.
-        The formal greeting is a hand on the heart, up to the forehead, before a quick bow in one continuous motion.

**Social Structure**
1. Seraephin (the Sun)
2. King Ceres
3. King Ceres’ Cardinals
4. Everyone else in government
5. Families or businesses that are important to the government
6. The upper class
7. The middle class
8. The lower class
9. Slaves
10. Literally anyone that’s not a Ceres-loving Aasiamr

**Writing and Communication**
-        Most use common and modern Aasimar. Though, some people still write with ancient Aasimar.
-        99% of the population is literate.

**Laws**
-        Ethegrafting and Golemancy are super illegal. Only the government can practice these. All other disciplines require a license.
-        Criticism of the government or of the war is strictly forbidden and is punishable by death.
-        No entry or exit of [[Lunfall]] (unless you’re a soldier, a government official, or a war prisoner).
-        All blasphemy is illegal.
They don’t take prisoners. After being judged and proven guilty, you’re either executed or enslaved.

### The Government
**The Aristocratic Wing**
This wing oversees the other 6. It’s where Ceres and his cardinals operate. It’s located in the Palace of Wings deep beneath [[Thesk]] inside [[Moonwrought]]. It’s an ancient, fortified sanctum that is completely inaccessible to the public (except the courtyard for public announcements, they can go there.) Ceres oversees a group of highly efficient and powerful Cardinals that enforce and deliver his will. They’re modified with an array of terrifying [[Bionite]] implants.

**The Military Wing**
This wing commands all Aasimar forces, ships, battalions, and spies. They’re also responsible for an expansive training program that ensures the youth grow into killing machines—picture Jojo Rabbit. The Grand Commander operates from the Palace of Wings, but below him are his admirals, their commanders, their captains, their lieutenants, and their privates.

**The Eterological Wing**
This wing ensures the progression of ether study. They’re composed of discipline specific sub-orders. They’re centralized in 10 or so different stations throughout [[Thesk]], but the Grand Arcanist operates in the Palace of Wings.

**The Theological Wing**
This wing oversees religious affairs, Ceres’ image, and public relations / propaganda. Centralized in the Sanctum of Seraephin in [[Thesk]]—the oldest and biggest temple of Seraphin. The Grand Bishop oversees a group of bishops, which oversee individual temples.

**The Commercial Wing**
This wing controls natural resources, trade, banking, and all economics. They’re overseen by the Grand Fiduciary in the Palace of Wings in [[Thesk]]. They control everything from Gold to [[Bionite]]. They don’t lend freely, and they have a gigantic reserve hidden in the Palace of Wings.

**The Judgement Wing**
This wing creates and debates the laws of Seraephin, commonly quoting the Testament of [[Lunfall]]. Located in the High Court of [[Thesk]] inside of the Palace of Wings, which is run by the Grand Judge. Smaller courts are run by individual judges. Each court has one judge that decides what to do with the defendant. You can appeal to the High Court if you wish, but this usually doesn’t work out.

**The Enforcement Wing**
This wing executes law enforcement across the Province. They surveil, investigate, and capture. They have golems that perform executions. They operate with swift, unflinching resolve. Overseen by the Grand Marshal in the Palace of Wings. Each island in [[Lunfall]] has a station run by a marshal.
