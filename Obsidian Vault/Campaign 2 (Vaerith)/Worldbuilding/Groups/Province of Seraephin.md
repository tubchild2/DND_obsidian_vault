They mostly use Aethotics for their machines, but bioeterology is extremely important too. Their libraries span hundreds of feet and have multiple stories. Their music is extremely powerful, both figuratively and literally. Truly, they are the masters of [[eterology]]. 

History:
~4000 BCE
- The ancient Aasimar native to [[Thesk|Lunfall]] write the "Verses of [[Moonwrought]]," a book of legends about the sun God Seraephin. They believe that [[The Eye of Seraephin|the moon]] is [[The Eye of Seraephin]], and that [[Moonwrought]] was its iris. 

82
- The Verses of [[Moonwrought]] are completed, and the Aasimar religion is completed. 

1757
- Cultivation of [[Bionite]] (artificial [[Moonwrought]] material) is discovered in [[Thesk]]. The process to produce [[Bionite]] is kept secret.

1762
- The [[province of Seraephin]] declares war on the rest of the world in light of their technological and eterological developments. Their superiority complex combined with their religious fanaticism made it deceptively simple to market the war to their citizens.

1768
- They've conquered several kingdoms, pushed back many others, and threatened everyone else.
