![[Lunfall Nature.jpg]]
### Description
Located in northwest [[Vaerith]]. Lunfall is a sight to behold. It's a gargantuan crater, about 30 miles across. Inside it is a hurricane of golden clouds. The winds below suspend a series of floating islands in perpetual orbit around a central pillar of stone in which the Aasimar capital [[Thesk]] was constructed. 

### History
The canyon was formed when [[Moonwrought]] fell to the earth. The impact was so grand that it created the Crescent of Ceres, and exploded the entire region. The crater was filled with a devastating whirlwind of golden clouds. The winds ripped the nearby terrain apart, suspending entire islands in the air. The archipelago of floating islands has come to be known as Lunfall.

The Aasimar were created here, and they quickly conquered the territory for themselves.
