![[Lunfall Basin.png]]
### Description
Contrary to [[Lunfall]], Covenul is dark, acid-ridden, and riddled with molten metals. Itâ€™s a horrible place for most everyone except the native species. It's highly ether potent due to being so close to [[moonwrought]], maybe too close. 

### History
The canyon was formed when [[Moonwrought]] fell to the earth. The impact was so grand that it created a mountain range, and exploded the entire region. Due to the nature of [[Moonwrought]], this, and the surrounding region's flora and fauna ([[Lunfall]] and The [[High Forest]]) were granted high ether potency. 
While the clouds suspending Lunfall are beautiful, what lies beneath them is a muted and mutated wasteland. The clouds blot out the sky, while the acid ridden mists corrode the remnants of bone.
