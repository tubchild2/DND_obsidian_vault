**Graceful Heirs of the Sea and Sky**
	The Ryujin are a rare people born of sea spirits and serpentine dragons and are distant cousins of the Dragonborn. They move like flowing water, speak with the effortless grace of nobility, and carry a natural connection to the tides and storms. Though now found in the distant Azure Jade Isles — a realm of floating lanterns, jade pagodas, and living dragon-bridges that rise from the waves at dawn — their past is wrapped in mystery. A thousand years ago, the Ryujin lived on islands close to the main continent of [[Vaerith]], thriving as seafarers and diplomats. For reasons no one understands, their entire people vanished almost overnight, leaving behind only shimmering ruins and weathered coastal temples. When they reappeared centuries later, they were far across the ocean, claiming the Azure Jade Isles as their true homeland. To questions about the Vanishing, they answer only with calm, cryptic phrases: “The tides took us home.” Today, the Ryujin are most often seen as scholars, diplomats, and scions of merchant-mage dynasties, their presence commanding attention like the calm before a storm.

**Appearance**
	Though touched by draconic blood, Ryujin resemble tall, elegant humans rather than heavily scaled creatures. Subtle traits mark their heritage: Hair flows as if drifting underwater, sometimes shimmering with faint iridescence or translucence. Eyes glimmer like moonlight on water and may carry faint slit pupils, reflecting light unnaturally. Their skin is smooth, with a pearlescent or light-blue sheen in certain light, more a natural glow than scales. Some display delicate fin-like frills near the ears or wrists, or a faint, misty wisp trailing from their backs or limbs when emotional or channeling power. They typically stand between 5 and 7 feet tall, favoring layered robes, silks, or light armor in oceanic hues, reflecting both their nobility and elemental ancestry. Their elegant, often androgynous features lend them a quiet, unearthly beauty, echoing the eastern dragons from which they descend.
