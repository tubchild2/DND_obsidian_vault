**Ashkara Resolve**  
Once per long rest, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can instead drop to 1 hit point.

**Tail**  
As an Ashkara, you have a long, articulated tail (6–9 feet in length). Once per turn, you can use your tail to take a special action called a **tail action**, which does not interfere with your normal action, bonus action, or reaction. Your tail cannot wield weapons, shields, or use ether abilities. It can be used to:

**Stinger**  
As part of your tail action, you can strike an enemy with your stinger. Your stinger is a natural finesse weapon that deals **1 piercing damage** and **1d4 poison damage**. On a hit, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of your next turn. The DC for this saving throw is equal to **8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier**.
