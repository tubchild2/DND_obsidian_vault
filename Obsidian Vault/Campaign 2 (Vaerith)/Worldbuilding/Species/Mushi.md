![[Fungus species.jpg]]

### Introduction
This species due to its unique fungal nature is not like any normal animal and it is up for debate whether they are a fungi or animal. Uncommon, despite being capable of growing throughout most [[Vaerith]].

### DND Abilities
**Traits**
- Age. They live indefinitely if fed and watered. Especially if kept in damp, nutrient-rich environments.
- Size. Small or medium humanoids. They vary in appearance; some are stocky mushroom-capped forms and some are wiry hyphae-wrapped figures.
- Speed. Your base walking speed is 30ft.
- Weight. You weigh about 16 pounds per foot of height.
- Dense. +2 constitution, -1 intelligence.
- Resistances. Resistant to radiant damage.
- Vulnerabilities. Vulnerable to piercing damage.
- Immunities. Immune to blindness.
- Proficiencies. You are proficient in perception.

**Spore Sight**
You are permanently blind, but you can see via a cloud of continuously yet subconsciously emitted spores. It functions similarly to LiDAR; the spores map your surroundings in a 100ft (20 tile) radius by detecting surfaces they touch, allowing you to perceive shapes, distances, and movement, but not text, color, texture, or shadows. The spores can drift around objects, allowing you to perceive your entire environment at once. You can see perfectly fine in the dark. In game, this grants you:
- Advantage on all sight related checks within 100ft.
- Disadvantages on all sight related checks beyond 100ft, or in environments not suitable for spores (too hot, too cold, water, acid, strong wind.)
- You can see perfectly in the dark.
- You can see through and around small cracks

**Regrowth**
Once per long rest, as an action, regain a number of hit points equal to a number of d8s equal to your proficiency bonus.

**Rooted Rest**
Instead of sleeping, you enter a dormant, inert state in a fixed spot for 4-6 hours to regain strength and restore abilities. You are fully conscious during this time.

### Appearance
- **Humanoid**. The race has the figure and shape of a human being with the normal female and male differences between genders.
- **Pale, Marbled Skin**. They have incredibly pale smooth skin white and pale as snow. The skin has small pink-red veins running beneath just under the surface in a marbled pattern. Their skin has a similar texture to other stationary fungi but is generally more firm and smoother, more similar to a human's skin.
- **A Little Stinky**. In general they smell of faint mildew and a herb like rosemary for example.
- **Anatomical Differences**. Many features you’d find on a human body are missing and are instead replaced by a smooth surface; their fingernails, toenails, genitalia, and eyes are all flat. Additionally, the do not have a standard digestive or reproductive system, though you can’t see that.
- **Hair**. Their hair is vaguely human, but thicker and veiny, giving it a red-pink hue.
- **Growths**. They often develop 2-3 fungal growths that resemble a paler, bumpier version of the Turkey tail fungi. They can grow anywhere, but are most common on the sides of the torso, legs, chest, face, and neck. Growths on hands are a deformity. These growths are remnants of the bulbs they grew from.

### Life Cycle
- **Seedling**. They begin as a small fungi that’s very similar to the Turkey tail fungi, but paler, bumpier, and in stranger patterns. These are typically found in trees with thick trunks, decaying animals, and (rarely) in nutrient rich soil. 
- **Bulb**. After suitable time has passed, a small bulb will develop outward from the mycelium. This bulb grows to approximately 2 ft in diameter as it consumes the structure it's growing from.
- **Cocoon**. Once the bulb is of adequate size, the mycelium will rapidly retract into the bulb as it begins forming a small, ~2 ft body. It attempts to perform this process in no less than 24 hours to avoid being exposed to predators in its developing form. This process can trigger early if the organic material it's rooted in is disturbed, though this occasionally causes fatal defects.
- **Youth**. After emerging, the young creature will begin searching for nutrient rich organic matter to continue developing. Around this stage, they’ll begin developing into either a male or female. This will affect their figure and personality. 
- **Adults**. When they’re done growing, they will shift their focus to long-term survival and satisfaction; this typically means finding loyal companions.
- **Reproduction**. Once they’re an adult, they can sever and plant part of themselves as a seedling to reproduce. This is a painful process that takes days to recover from; it’s not something most choose to do.

### Biology
**General**
- Fungal composition far faster and far smarter.
- Each system acts with a single, intelligent mind.

**Skeletal System**
- Composed of a single, cartilage-like “bone,”
- Shaped similarly to and appears like the human skeleton.
- Highly flexible joints, can stiffen at will.

**Skin**
- Thin outer layer (~0.5mm), like firm fungi.

**Flesh**
- Sponge-like fungal tissue fills the body.
- Acts as muscle, brain, and support.
- Contains hollow veins that:
	- Transport nutrients, spores, and other materials to the whole body.
	- Are visible under skin, fade to white when transporting matter.

**Feeding**
- Consumes food via the mouth.
- Nutrients distributed through the veins.
- Items traveling in veins turn white, which is visible while eating, or when things are moving through the body.

**Respiration**
- Large, lung-like organs in the chest. They produce millions of spores per second, which travel through the veins before being expelled via the nose, mouth, or hair. 
- Spores create a 360-degree sensory map of the surroundings. Similar to LiDAR, but biological. 
- Can detect: shapes, distances, movement, and braille.
- Cannot detect: written text, light based visuals, color, texture, or shadows.

**Hair**
- One of the primary spore vents.
- Filled with nerves and veins, making it painful to cut.
- Often left uncut.
