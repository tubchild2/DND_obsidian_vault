**Traits**
- **Age.** Umbra do not age and are immune to aging effects. 
- **Size.** Umbra are medium humanoids.
- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30ft.
- **Weight.** Umbra weigh 300-360lbs on average.
- **Fragile.** Your constitution score decreases by 2.
- **Clever.** You increase your intelligence or wisdom scores by 2.
- **Needs.** Umbra don't need food, water, or air. But, they do need to absorb dust regularly, and they do need to rest.

**Telekinesis**
As an action, Umbra can create a number of floating hands made of dust and loose particulates. During this action, you can command each hand to perform any action a hand can do. Unlike mage hand, these hands are visible, they can be used to deal damage via thrown objects, and they improve with progression. 
- Intelligent creatures can very easily disrupt the telekinetic ether binding the hands together at close range. In other words, you cannot move, restrain, or grapple a non-willing creature. This means you *can* use it on anything that actively allows it!
- The hands cannot deal direct damage due to the rule above. However, throwing items is an extremely effective way to deal damage. Throwing an item is a ranged ether attack, requiring you to roll to hit by adding your ether attack modifier.

**Umbral Meditation**
Once per short rest, Umbra can meditate to unlock their full potential. They enter this trance with an action. It lasts for the following 3 turns (ending early if you're hit, moved, or if you end it with a bonus action) and it grants the following effects:
- **Immobile.** You cannot move or be moved, take actions, or take bonus actions. The only thing you can do is use telekinesis, or end the meditation. All attacks rolls against you have advantage, as your awareness is completely withdrawn.
- **Fragile.** Your body becomes unstable and exposed. You are vulnerable to physical damage (double damage from bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing).
- **Dangerous.** While in this trance, your telekinetic abilities are supercharged. You gain double the number of hands, can lift twice the weight per hand, and your maximum distance is doubled.

**Umbral Collapse**
When you are reduced to 0 hit points, and fail your final saving throw, you have the choice to collapse in a gravitational implosion. All creatures within a number of feet equal to 10 times your proficiency bonus must make a constitution saving throw with disadvantage. If they fail, they take force damage equal to a number of d12s equal to your proficiency bonus.

**Void Soul**
- **Intangibility.** Immune to all physical damage and effects; cannot touch or move objects. 
- **Action Economy.** The Void Soul acts on the Umbra's turn. It can take a single action per turn, but only for tasks like aiding, recalling information, or storing items--not ether, attacking, item interactions, etc.
- **Knowledge Bearer.** They are experts at history, though they are limited to knowledge they've acquired where their Umbra visited.
- **Pocket Space.** Void Souls contain a 500lb. extradimensional space in an 8ft. interior sphere. As a free object interaction, the Umbra may store or retrieve any item within it. The Void Soul can always locate stored items instantly. 
- **Lifelong Companion.** They are paired with the Umbra from birth, and aid them forever. They are fiercely loyal, though not capable of much.
- **Bound Voice.** They only speak when spoken to, or on matters of grave importance.
- **Umbra Bound.** Though capable of flight, they cannot move more than 15ft. from their Umbra. If their Umbra dies, the void soul stays with its body until the void soul fizzles out.

**Biology**
- **Smoke Form.** The umbra appear as humanoid forms made of twisting black smoke. They're so dark that they seem wrong to look at. It's less that they're made of something dark, and more that light avoids them. This is because the singularity is absorbing incoming light and warping gravity around them to maintain their volatile forms.
- **Limited Needs.** They don't "eat" and more "absorb." They need a constant supply of dust and rocks to perpetuate their form.

**Flavor**
- **Anti-Elf Sentiment.** Umbra hold ancient grudges against the Elves. The commonly use slurs like, "Knife Ears." In contrast, they love Dwarves and other earth-dwelling creatures.
- **Singularity.** Every Umbra contains a marble of impossibly dense material. This singularity shifts the dust and mass around it to create the body. Its gravitational pull is bound to the shape of its body. When excited or afraid, the field ripples, causing visible effects on the form. This is the essence of their being, but it's very fragile. When the body is damaged, so too is it's gravitational field.
- **Historical Significance.** Slim to none. They haven't been involved in much, despite being the oldest people in [[Vaerith]]. They are largely unaware of their blood relation to [[The Eye of Seraephin|the moon]].
- **Craves Knowledge.** They have an innate hunger for knowledge.
