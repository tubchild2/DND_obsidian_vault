Bionite is artificial moon rock. It's grown and mined directly from [[Moonwrought]] and its fragments. 
It's unique because it's Ether potency can be transferred between nodes. The process to do so is simple, you just need to touch them together, and use Ether to do it. You need to expend a Lvl 1 spell slot regardless of the transferred potency. You cannot split Ether potency.

Mined in the Crescent of Ceres by the Drakoshians, and exported to the rest of Vaerith.
Mined in Lunfall by the Aasimar. They get way more since they have the direct source.


Mining: Done in Drakoshia, and in Lunfall
Refining: Done in 


Properties:
- 0.25ft^3 of Bionite is 1lb (3 inch cube)
- Stringy blue rock.
