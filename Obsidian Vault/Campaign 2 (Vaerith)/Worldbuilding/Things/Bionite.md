Bionite is moon rock. It's grown directly from [[Moonwrought]] through careful cultivation.
It's unique because it's Ether potency can be transferred between nodes. The process to do so is simple, you just need to touch them together, and use Ether to do it. You need to expend a Lvl 1 spell slot regardless of the transferred potency. 



Properties:
- 0.25ft^3 of Bionite is 1lb (3 inch cube)
- Chalky blue material.
