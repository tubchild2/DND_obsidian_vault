### Description
Maje claims that a vehicle known as the "Dream Machine" exists, scattered across different parts throughout [[Vaerith]]. He doesn't remember how he knows this, but he knows it was either forgotten or hidden. He wants to get it before someone else does. According to him, it's capable of tearing through space to achieve ridiculous speeds.
### History
The Dream Machine was developed by the Grand Arcanist of the [[Province of Seraephin]] in 1741, making it was one of the first [[Bionite]] / steam engine machines. It was constructed using lost Umbra technology, allowing it to manipulate local gravity. It's shorthand name was DM-77
The Grand Arcanist at the time was Mirran Oja. He died in combat near Watcher's Bluff. By the time his body was recovered, the DM-77 had already been stolen. The thieves couldn't operate it so they disassembled it and split the parts between a few shipments. The shipments were meant to arrive at 3 hidden caches, but two never made it. Now, all that remains of the DM-77 is a series of breadcrumbs and myths. Some question its very existence. 
However, that one cache that did receive a shipment seems like a good place to start.
### Traits
- **Attuned.** The DM-77 requires a master. Unless attuned with a fingerprint and blood sample, the bike won't operate.
- **Speed.** The dream machine has a top speed of 90mph, and can accelerate and decelerate very quickly.
- **Teleportation.** After accelerating to full speed the dream machine can teleport once per master's long rest to any location known that the master has been to. This teleportation transports exclusively the master. Momentum is preserved through teleportation.
- **Semi-Sentient.** Though incapable of communication, it longs to assist its master through whatever means possible. It'll lock its brakes, use mage hand, passively follow, ram people, drive itself, or escort people.
