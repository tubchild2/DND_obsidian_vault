![[Ring of Lunalia and the Ring of Seraephin.jpg]]

### Origins
In roughly 1100 BCE, the Order of [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]] created two rings using their forbidden knowledge of ether potency siphoning. They were both formed from a secret alloy of ancient [[bionite]]. Neither can be removed by choice by the bearer, as they grow in strength, the bond becomes stronger until they lose control and fight whoever tries to remove it. Due to primarily siphoning elements of the mind, the rings appear to become semi-sentient as their power compounds.

The [[Order of Lunalia]] planned to charge both rings over time. They prophesied that one would acquire both, and attain enough power to awaken the [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]]. 

### Function
The Ring of [[Seraephin]] siphons the ether potency of each subsequent bearer. If removed by force, the user loses all ether potency. Impels patriotism on the bearer in the voice of past kings. Greatly improves their skill as tacticians and leaders.

The Ring of [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]] siphons the ether potency of anyone killed by the bearer. Its power is released when the user dies. If removed by force, the user dies and the ring resets. As its power grows, the ring compels the user to crave power and death in the voice of those its slain.

### History
Later that year, the Ring of [[Seraephin]] was stolen by the [[Province of Seraephin]] to gain an unexpected victory over the Order of [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]]. It has been passed down from king to king for nearly 3000 years, meaning it currently contains the ether potency of 60 kings. 

The Ring of [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]] was kept secret, and was given only to the leaders of the cult. For nearly 3000 years its been kept secret and used in secret by some of history's most devastating killers. General Maulfaust of Aridia secretly used the ring to form the Maulfaust Crest mountain range. Unfortunately, one of its users was killed at an unknown location, causing the ring to be lost.
