- [[Ceres]] needed to become the new leader of the Province to acquire the [[The Ring of Seraephin and the Ring of Lunalia|Ring of Seraephin]], but he still needs the [[The Ring of Seraephin and the Ring of Lunalia|Ring of Lunalia]].
- The Cultists swarm the party to acquire the [[The Ring of Seraephin and the Ring of Lunalia|Ring of Lunalia]]. By this point, if anyone is wearing the ring, they're very strongly affected by it. I want them to betray the party here if they haven't already removed the ring.
