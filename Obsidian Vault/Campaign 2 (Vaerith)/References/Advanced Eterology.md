# Aethotics
**Origins of Aethotics**
- Aethotics, in the simplest terms, is any electrical or steam powered device that has had eterology incorporated into it. It's a hybrid of early-industrial technology and eterology. 
- It originated in Lunfall in 1712 with the invention of the steam engine. It skyrocketed in 1757 with the discovery of Bionite. It's most common in Lunfall, but it's practiced everywhere.
**Quirks of Aethotics**
- Use of gears and pistons to switch programmers to allow for multipurpose weapons.
- Ability to integrate into any mechanical device. This means you can set up timers, detectors, puzzles, traps, etc.
- Allows for more "intelligent" usage of the other disciplines. 
**Golemancy**
- Golemancy is sub-discipline of Aethotics. 
- Golemancy involves the use of a preserved brain (or brains) as programmers, typically for artificial bodies. 
- These brains become fully simulated via the ether understanding how they functioned. However, they will rot if not preserved extremely carefully. 
- Most common in places with extreme temperatures, or where preservation techniques are adequately advanced. 

# Ethellurgy
**Origins of Ethellurgy**
- There is a much more costly version of Bionite's increasable Ether potency
**Ether Potent Metals**
- Conductivity, malleability, lustrousness, ductility, melting point, density, durability, ether potency.
- Whether a metal or gemstone is ether potent depends on two things. First, does it have a lot of carbon. Second, is its internal structure reminiscent of organic matter's composition. If both are true, then when exposed to low voltages, these metals or gems will produce Ether. Diamond and certain steels are common for this.

# Literography
**Origins of Literography**
- Literography is an extremely important aspect of ether item creation. When programming ether, the most common technique is to use writing. It's precise, replicable, accessible, and deep. With that said, more complex ether abilities require much attention to detail.
- Ancient eterologists dedicated entire rooms of written text to program ether, but thanks to advancements in language, this is no longer necessary. The invention of ether shorthand allows for complex ideas to be conveyed very efficiently.

**Basics of Literography**
Creating a script for the ether to read requires a fundamental understanding of programmingâ€”particularly in the style of the C language. Ether scripts are step-by-step instructions that the ether follows while manifesting an ether ability. It reads the text line by line, top to bottom, page by page, and performs the specified actions exactly as written.

**Encoding**
Encoding is the practice of compressing complex ideas and words into single characters using ancient Aasimar symbols. 
- Thanks to the nature of ancient Aasimar, you could combine all 24 symbols into one character.
- There is a process used by elite Literographers to define symbols to represent complex ideas or words. First remove all repeated symbols, then arrange the word alphabetically, and then combine all of the letters into one symbol in ancient Aasimar. 
- Each one of these symbols now carries a pure idea, unburdened by grammar or syntax.
- As long as no letters are repeated or reordered, almost any word or concept can be distilled into a compact symbol.
- Making frequent use of these symbols allow for extremely efficient space use.

**Abstraction**
Abstraction takes encoding even further by introducing functions--named, reusable blocks of Literographic instructions. 
- Instead of repeating a long sequence of actions multiple times, you can define it once as a function, and simply reference it at any point later on.
- In the example, we see the function "sum" being defined. Then, it's used later on to determine what 1 + 2 is.
- These save an ungodly amount of space, but they must be declared before they are used.
```example
int sum (int a, int b)
{
	int c = 0;
	c = a + b;
	return c;
}

start
{
	int answer = 0;
	answer = sum(1, 2);
	return;
}
```

**Other Literography Techniques and Errors**
- You can define and manage variables within text. For example, you can define a variable called "num1" and add and subtract from it later on. 
- It's unlikely to find any experienced literographer starting a tome from scratch. People make fortunes selling starter tomes which contain a library of common functions and the standardized symbols.
- Recursive loops can have explosive consequences that end the manifestation early. 
- Allocating but never using memory can slow the process, and cause phantom manifestations or unintended side effects.
- Syntax errors cause the ether to stop following the script and to manifest early.
- Working with two different versions of the same starter tome can lead to confusion and syntax errors.

**History of Literography and Influential Literographers**
- Encoded symbols are agreed upon and standardized by [[The Council of Literography]] that meets annually. It's the one time of year Lunfall is open to the public despite the wars--it's like the Olympics of Eterology. While you can ignore the standardized symbols and make your own, that can get very complicated and unpredictable. That's why it's helpful to stick stick to the standard encoded symbols with a mix of longhand ancient Aasimar. 

# Symphology
- 
# Theochemy
- Cooperative ether use is a very powerful tool. It is heavily tied to belief. The more unshakable ones' beliefs are, the stronger the ether user becomes.
- Group prayer can be used to manifest specific yet highly abstract thoughts.
