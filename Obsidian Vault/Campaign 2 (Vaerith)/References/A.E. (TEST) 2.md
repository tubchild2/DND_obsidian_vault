# Bioeterology
### History
- Bioeterology is the oldest branch of Eterology--it's the study and augmentation of ether in nature. Before people could use Ether, they studied bioeterology. 
### Core Concepts
**Natural Ether Flow**
- Ether forms under very specific circumstances. If dense networks made with primarily carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and/or sulfur receive a low-voltage current, unprogrammed Ether will form. These materials are known as "Ether conductors."
- It's hard to picture that, so think of it this way: pretty much exclusively brains produce Ether. However, under very specific circumstances, other forms of life and even metals can produce Ether.
- All Ether starts unprogrammed. In most cases, it is immediately and rapidly programmed by the thoughts of the brain that formed it. In unintelligent ether sources, the ether stays unprogrammed.
- Ether flows from its source out the most natural path. The rules for how this works vary from professional to professional since it's near impossible to gather concrete data. What we know, is that it'll take the most "obvious" path out, like flowing from the brain to the fingers in humans. However, the ideological charge of the particle seems to have some influence, since it's completely possible for Eterologists to control which path the flow takes. 
- For reasons beyond our current understanding, Ether cannot manifest while inside of organic matter.
- We don't currently understand Ether potency. For reasons beyond our understanding, some objects produce more Ether than others. In the case of organic matter, it can be both inherited and improved upon with time. We do not understand why, but some theorists suggest that some ratios of chemicals produce more than others. They believe that prolonged exposure to Ether can alter the ratios of these chemicals to produce more Ether--they go as far as to suggest the makeup of their DNA has been altered.
**Unnatural Ether Flow**
- These concepts can be pushed even further. By using specially crafted organic materials or (in rare cases) Ether conductive materials, you can construct wires and capacitors.
- Ether conductive wires transport Ether from a source out. Ether will not arc, so the connection must be complete. If they're made from organic material, they need to be preserved.
- Ether conductive capacitors trap Ether in a perpetual loop until an exit is introduced. These are remarkably useful for building up larger quantities of Ether over time. They can't hold infinite Ether obviously; eventually the capacitors will break. If capacitors overload, the manifestations can be unpredictable and dangerous so it's bad practice to push their limits. 
### Ethegrafting
**Core Concepts**
- Ethegrafting is a somewhat dangerous method of improving one's Ether potency. By inserting objects into ones body, you can artificially "increase" your ether potency. The basic principle is that a particle of ether charged with a thought could contact one of these implants, multiplying it as the unprogrammed ether copies the new idea. 
- Due to the way Ether flows through the body, implants near the head, brainstem, and neck are going to be the most controllable because ether almost always flows through them (unless specified not to). Implants in other locations must be activated by the user.
- Implants have a limited amount of ether that they can produce in a day; they must have time to recharge after use.
### Ethepathology
**Core Concepts**
- Ethepathology is the study of Ether specifically in intelligent life.
- It deals with several important aspects of being an eterologist. They're like the doctors of ether.
- Some important factors they consider are Ether disorders, Ether medicines, Ether exercises, Ether viruses, and more.
**Ether Disorders and Infections**
- Hyperathemia. A genetic abnormality causing massively enhanced ether potency. Most children born with this condition die within 6 months due to their abilities. Older patients must be remarkably careful to control themselves, especially during times of heightened emotional distress. There is no known cure.
- Hypoathemia. A genetic abnormality causing a complete inability to produce a usable amount of ether.
- Anidea Virus. A transmissible viral worm that grows around the brain and feeds off ether construction. They pass the unprogrammed ether through their DNA to reproduce quickly throughout the body. This can be extremely deadly, and once infected, you have only a few days to find a cure--all without access to any ether. There is no consistent way to cure the virus. Some believe shared lucid dreams can be helpful, others believe surgery is the only way.
- Emotethemia. A genetic abnormality that prevents conscious control and production of ether without being in a heightened emotional state. While distressed, you become as powerful as 10 men, but you lack self-control.
### Somnology
**Core Concepts**
- Entering the dream state is challenging if you're doing it naturally. Lucid dreaming is the least harmful method. However, you won't get the crazy good results unless you're under the influence of something very powerful. Drunkenness, powerful hallucinogens, and hard stimulants all perform extremely well.
- While dreaming, all of your thoughts become extremely ether potent. You have double your standard power, but an unfortunate side effect of this is that your subconscious might also begin to manifest. Fears, nightmares, traumas, bad memories, and more might begin to manifest, and you'll have to deal with them after you're done if you fail to completely control yourself.
