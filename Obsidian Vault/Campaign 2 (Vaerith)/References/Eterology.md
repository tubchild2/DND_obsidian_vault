### Ether
Ether is a particle that contains a soup of atoms. These atoms are in a superposition between states due to reality subtly bending around them. Whenever something of any intelligence thinks, Ether particles form as a byproduct. Each particle of Ether is charged with the idea that formed them.
But Ether wasn’t meant to exist in this world—It’s far too impossible. The instant it forms, the Ether’s superposition collapses. The atoms then collect and form a piece of whichever idea they were charged with. For example, Ether particles charged with the idea "chair" will attempt to form a chair. Given enough particles, they will.

### Ether Potency
The amount and quality of Ether an organism produces depends on a lot of factors. 
1. Species. Some species are simply more Ether potent than others. 
2. Focus. Preventing unwanted thoughts from entering your mind while using Ether. 
3. Practice. Skill plays a large factor. Knowing what you're doing increases your potency with time.
4. Conscience. Your sense of self can have a large impact on your Ether potency. 
5. Emotion. Emotionally charged Ether can be powerful but unpredictable.
6. Reasoning. The speed at which you reason has an impact on your Ether potency. 
7. Sleep. How rested you are greatly impacts your ability to focus. 
8. Dreams. Dreaming doubles your potency, but it requires immense skill to even attempt this.
### Ether Items
It’s more than possible to create items that take advantage of the power of Ether. But, before you can do any of that, you need something to produce Ether. Throughout history, Eterologists of all different kinds have been known to get creative with this. They’ve used plants, animals, monster parts, cross-bred organic material, slime mold, insect hives, and more.

Given these sources are unintelligent, they produce “thoughtless Ether.” The Ether is either charged with no ideas, or with very weak and easily overwritten ideas. Thoughtless Ether conducts ideas on contact, allowing Eterologists to essentially program what they want the Ether to do. They’ve also been known to get creative with this, using books, paintings, engraved plates, environmental sounds, preserved brains, and more.

### Disciplines of Eterology
**Classes of Eterology**
1. Artificers. Ether users that rely on Ether items to supplement their low Ether potency.
2. Bards. Ether users that use music and art as a source of inspiration and focus.
3. Clerics. Ether users that use religion as a means of inspiration and focus. Their religions tend to be life based, often focusing on healing others.
4. Druids. Ether users that are heavily tied to nature.
5. Paladins. Ether users that use religion as a means of inspiration and focus for combat. They’re devout warriors.  
6. Rangers. Ether users that are more practical and tied to nature.
7. Sorcerers. Ether users that are naturally Ether potent.
8. Warlocks. Ether users that rely on religion as a means of focus and inspiration. Their religions tend to be more outlandish and specific, often focusing on oaths of servitude and commitments.
9. Wizards. Ether users that earned their Ether potency through academia.

**Branches of Eterology**
1. Aethotics. The study and application of ether-infused technology.
2. Bioeterology. The study and augmentation of ether in nature, and of ether sources.
3. Ethegrafting. Dangerously implanting objects to increase your ether potency.
4. Ethellurgy. Forging ether potent alloys for tools, weapons, etc.
5. Literography. Scribes that use shorthand and Ether books to convey ideas and produce effects.
6. Somnology. A difficult practice using dreams and unconscious states to enhance ether abilities.
7. Symphology. Using music and art to inspire focus for more powerful ether use.
8. Theochemy. The practice of cooperative ether use. Typically tied to religious practices.
9. Golemancy. Using a preserved brain (or multiple brains) to power artificial bodies using Ether.
