### History
~66,000,000 BCE
- A fragment of [[The Eye of Seraephin|the moon]] (later named "[[Moonwrought]]" by native Aasimar) lands and wipes out the dinosaurs. [[Moonwrought]] landed in [[Thesk|Lunfall]] Basin, creating a massive crater. 
- [[Moonwrought]] spreads its Ether potent organic matter to the nearby plants, which then transfer to the native animals. This creates the [[High Forest]], and is the source of all Ether potency in plants and animals.

~4,000 BCE
- Adam, Eve, and their species counterparts are created throughout the world. 
- They sin, resulting in the greater loss of perfection.
- The ancient Aasimar native to [[Thesk|Lunfall]] write the "Verses of [[Moonwrought]]," a book of legends about the sun God Seraephin. They believe that [[The Eye of Seraephin|the moon]] is [[The Eye of Seraephin]], and that [[Moonwrought]] was its iris. 

~3,500 BCE
- Basic [[Eterology]] is discovered in the area surrounding [[Lunfall]] and the [[High Forest]]. 

82
- The Verses of [[Moonwrought]] are completed, and the Aasimar religion is completed. 

1712
- The steam engine is invented in [[Thesk]].

1757
- Cultivation of [[Bionite]] (artificial [[Moonwrought]] material) is discovered in [[Thesk]]. The process to produce [[Bionite]] is kept secret.

1762
- The [[province of Seraephin]] declares war on the rest of the world in light of their technological and eterological developments. Their superiority complex combined with their religious fanaticism made it deceptively simple to market the war to their citizens.

1768 (present day)
- The continent of Vaerith stands perched on a slippery slope. The world is unbalanced, chaotic, and muddled. The Province of Seraephin (the kingdom of the Aasimar) stands as the apex of innovation; theyâ€™ve surpassed all the kingdoms of Vaerith in a technological revolution.
- A series of sudden invasions have left the nations of Vaerith in a territorial tug-of-war. Several kingdoms have been suppressed to near extinction, and few still have the courage to challenge the ever-expanding armies of the Aasimar. Though outnumbered, the Aasimar have the world outmatched.
