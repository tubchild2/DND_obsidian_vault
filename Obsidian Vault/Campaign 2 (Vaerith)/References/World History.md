### History
~66,000,000 BCE
- A fragment of [[The Eye of Seraephin|the moon]] (later named "[[Moonwrought]]" by native Aasimar) lands and wipes out the dinosaurs. [[Moonwrought]] landed in [[Thesk|Lunfall]], creating a massive crater, and the crescent of ceres.
- [[Moonwrought]] spreads its Ether potent organic matter to the nearby plants, which then transfer to the native animals. This creates the [[High Forest]], and is the source of all Ether potency in plants and animals.

~4,000 BCE
- Adam, Eve, and their species counterparts are created throughout the world. 
- They sin, resulting in the greater loss of perfection.
- The ancient Aasimar native to [[Thesk|Lunfall]] write the "Verses of [[Moonwrought]]," a book of legends about the sun God Seraephin. They believe that [[The Eye of Seraephin|the moon]] is [[The Eye of Seraephin]], and that [[Moonwrought]] was its iris. 

~3,500 BCE
- Basic [[Eterology]] is discovered in the area surrounding [[Lunfall]] and the [[High Forest]]. 

82
- The Verses of [[Moonwrought]] are completed, and the Aasimar religion is completed. 

1712
- The steam engine is invented in [[Thesk]].

1757
- Cultivation of [[Bionite]] (artificial [[Moonwrought]] material) is discovered in [[Thesk]]. The process to produce [[Bionite]] is kept secret.

1762
- The [[Province of Seraephin]] took part in a series of sudden invasions against the rest of the world. Their technological advantage and their religious fanaticism made the war horribly easy to market to their citizens.

1768 (present day)
- The continent of [[Vaerith]] stands on a slippery slope. The [[Province of Seraephin]] (the kingdom of the Aasimar) stands as the apex of innovation; they’ve surpassed all the kingdoms of [[Vaerith]] in a technological revolution.
- The nations of [[Vaerith]] are stuck in a territorial tug-of-war with the Aasimar. Several kingdoms have been suppressed to near extinction, others have been wiped out entirely. The remaining kingdoms lack the courage (and the might) to challenge the ever-expanding might of the Aasimar. Though terribly outnumbered, the Aasimar have [[Vaerith]] outmatched.
- Rumors are circulating about [[Bionite]] being the key to their new weapons.
- As long as the nations of [[Vaerith]] are cooperating, they can match the Aasimar. The minute they’re destabilized, however, the world risks utter destruction.
