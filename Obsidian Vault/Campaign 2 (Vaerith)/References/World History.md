### History
~66,000,000 BCE
- A fragment of [[The Eye of Seraephin|the moon]] (later named "[[Moonwrought]]" by native Aasimar) lands and wipes out the dinosaurs. [[Moonwrought]] landed in northwestern [[Vaerith]], creating a massive crater ([[Lunfall]] and [[Covenul]]), and the Crescent of Ceres. It also brought with it [[Umbra]], which were buried near the center of the earth ([[Underdark]]).
- [[Moonwrought]] spreads its Ether potent organic matter to the nearby plants, which then transfer to the native animals. This creates the [[High Forest]], and is the source of all Ether potency in plants and animals.

~4,000 BCE
- Adam, Eve, and their species counterparts are created throughout the world. 
- They sin, resulting in the greater loss of perfection.

~3,500 BCE
- Basic [[Eterology]] is discovered.

1741
- Cultivation of [[Bionite]] is discovered in [[Thesk]]. The process to produce [[Bionite]] is kept secret.
- The steam engine is invented in [[Thesk]].

1746
- The [[Province of Seraephin]] took part in a series of sudden invasions against the rest of the world, spearheaded by their new fascist leader Ceres. Their technological advantage, their numbers, and their complete devotion to violence made the sudden invasion devastating. 

1768 (present day)
- The continent of [[Vaerith]] stands on a slippery slope. The [[Province of Seraephin]] (the kingdom of the Aasimar) stands as the apex of innovation; they’ve surpassed all the kingdoms of [[Vaerith]] in a technological revolution.
- The nations of [[Vaerith]] are stuck in a territorial tug-of-war with the Aasimar. Several kingdoms have been suppressed to near extinction, others have been wiped out entirely. The remaining kingdoms lack the courage (and the might) to challenge the ever-expanding might of the Aasimar. Though terribly outnumbered, the Aasimar have [[Vaerith]] outmatched.
- Rumors are circulating about [[Bionite]] being the key to their new weapons.
- As long as the nations of [[Vaerith]] are cooperating, they can match the Aasimar. The minute they’re destabilized, however, the world risks utter destruction.
