### History
~150,000,000 BCE
- The dream begins.
- [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]] and [[Seraephin]] form. 
- [[The Eye of Seraephin|Lunalia]] creates the [[Umbra]], and [[Seraephin]] creates the Aasimar.

~66,000,000 BCE
- A fragment of [[The Eye of Seraephin|the moon]] (later named "[[Moonwrought]]" by native Aasimar) lands and wipes out the dinosaurs. [[Moonwrought]] landed in northwestern [[Vaerith]], creating a massive crater ([[Lunfall]] and [[Covenul]]), and the Crescent of [[Ceres]]. It also brought with it [[Umbra]], which were buried near the center of the earth ([[Underdark]]). It also fragmented during the fall, burying millions of pounds of [[Bionite]] in the surrounding land.
- [[Moonwrought]] spreads its Ether potent organic matter to the nearby plants, which then transfer to the native animals. This creates the [[High Forest]].

~4,000 BCE
- Most species blink into existence.
- The Aasimar are brought to [[Vaerith]] by [[Seraephin]].

~3,500 BCE
- Basic [[Eterology]] is discovered.

1741
- [[Bionite]] is discovered in [[Thesk]]. It's native to the general area surrounding [[Lunfall]].
- The steam engine is invented in [[Thesk]].

1746
- The [[Province of Seraephin]] took part in a series of sudden invasions against the rest of the world, spearheaded by their new fascist leader [[Ceres]]. Their technological advantage, their numbers, and their complete devotion to violence made the sudden invasion devastating. 

1768 (present day)
- The continent of [[Vaerith]] stands on a slippery slope. The [[Province of Seraephin]] (the kingdom of the Aasimar) stands as the apex of innovation; they’ve surpassed all the kingdoms of [[Vaerith]] in a technological revolution.
- The nations of [[Vaerith]] are stuck in a territorial tug-of-war with the Aasimar. Several kingdoms have been suppressed to near extinction, others have been wiped out entirely. The remaining kingdoms lack the courage (and the might) to challenge the ever-expanding might of the Aasimar. Though terribly outnumbered, the Aasimar have [[Vaerith]] outmatched.
- As long as the nations of [[Vaerith]] are cooperating, they can match the Aasimar. The minute they’re destabilized, however, the world risks utter destruction.
