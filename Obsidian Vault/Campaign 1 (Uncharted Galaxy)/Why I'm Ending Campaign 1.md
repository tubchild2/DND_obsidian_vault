### Reason #1: Campaign #1 Was a Demo
- This campaign was created to experiment with DND to see if we enjoyed it, and to learn how to play. We know how to do that now, and we can go into a second session with all of that gained knowledge.
- I made choices in the world under the guise of many assumptions about DND. These radically complicated things, and it's causing me to do all of the writing when it's really the players that should during the session. It's too late to rectify these choices, causing each session to take far too long.
- I set things up to be an Uncharted style treasure hunt where we could try a bunch of different settings and we abandoned it almost immediately which kind of messed things up.

### Reason #2: I'm So Ready for Campaign 2
- Campaign #2 (working title) will be:
	- More fantastical. I'll use the system for rewritten magic I've been working on, allowing us to play DND without spiritism. Takes full advantage of the Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master's Guide, and the Monster Manual. 
	- More streamlined. It'll be set on ONE planet, which removes the issue of hyper-expansion. I can create the setting, briefly explain the gist of it, and that'll be it. No more unnecessarily complex worldbuilding that only I know. You'll have the basics going into the world, and we'll expand off that.
	- More roleplay and character focused (as it should be). Now that you know the basics, you can choose to make your next characters with more care.
		- Character is the forefront! Goals, backstory, lore, and actual personalities will be created way in advance to session 1 (NO 10-HOUR SESSION 0). The game is meant to be a collaborative story, not one where I write everything. The fault falls on me for setting that expectation, but in Campaign #2 everyone can create their lore with as much detail as they see fit. 
		- All classes--especially those from the PHB--are playable (I now understand them all), including sorcerer, warlock, and wizard; though they will be tweaked to dodge spiritism. Artificer is also playable should you express interest in it.
		- All races--especially those from the PHB--are playable, though, once again, they will be tweaked to dodge spiritism.
	- There will be actual rules this time
		- No "bad" characters or actions done for the purpose of shocking people. Literally Ephesians 5:3-5. Flaws are vital to any good character, but saying that they're just a bad person or using that as an excuse to be perverse or violent at the table is not ok. You will be asked to leave, since it harms the game for the people around you.
		- No one-shots with the characters from my campaign. One-shots or event full campaigns set in my world are totally fine, but for balancing and plot reasons, they've got to use different characters.
		- Lets please switch up who hosts every once and awhile. I can't enforce this, but please.
	- More balanced! The economy, the loot, the rules, all of that, will make sense and won't be needlessly confusing! It'll be more traditional. 

### Reason #3: Third Thing Here
- Fun fact: lists sound better with three parts. This rhetorical device is known as the "tricolon."
