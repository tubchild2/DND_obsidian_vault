### Eathyst
**General Information**
- **Eathyst Produces [[Ether]].** Eathyst is a semi-organic substance made of crystalized [[Ether]] mixed with a variety of other random chemicals. It meets the bare minimum requirements to "think" and produce unprogrammed [[Ether]] without being actually organic. 
- **Forms From Sources of Unprogrammed [[Ether]].** Things like [[Portals]], certain E-Tech devices, or [[Ether]] users with cleared minds produce raw Eathyst. Fun Fact: to produce high-grade Eathyst, creatures made of Eathyst have to sacrifice some of their power until the Eathyst is reabsorbed. 
- **Electrical Response.** The structure of Eathyst resembles neurons. When exposed to electricity, the Eathyst will produce unprogrammed [[Ether]].
- **Raw Eathyst.** Unprocessed Eathyst produces a set amount of [[Ethology Reference Table|Pytes]] per hour when exposed to electricity. See "[[Ethology Reference Table]]" for more information. 

**Measurements**
- [[Ethology Reference Table|Pyte]]-Total. An integer denoting how many [[Ethology Reference Table|Pytes]] of [[Ether]] are contained within the unit of Eathyst. 
- [[Ethology Reference Table|Pyte]]-Rate. Measured in [[Ethology Reference Table|Pytes]] per hour. 
- Grade. A shorthand method for denoting the [[Ethology Reference Table|Pyte]]-Total of a unit of Eathyst. 

**Properties**
- Melts at 1,084c
- Boils at 2,562c
- Density: 3g / cm^3
- Worth 375c per gram
- Worth 1125c per cubic centimeter
- Fragile
- Semi-Transparent

**PPH Transference.** 
	The PPH of Eathyst can be transferred to and from units of Eathyst, but it cannot be created using this process. When melted, the structure of the Eathyst becomes unstable (and unusable). If it were to come into contact with another unit of Eathyst that's more stable, the [[Ether]] would transfer into it, increasing its [[Ethology Reference Table|Pyte]]-Total.

### Eathyst Alloys
**Forming Eathyst Alloys**
	By mixing liquified Eathyst with another liquified metal, you can create an Eathyst alloy. Eathyst alloys have the physical traits of the metal, with the PPH of the Eathyst.

**E-Tech Components**
Conductors and Resistors
	Won't produce [[Ether|Ether]], but will function as an [[Ether|Ether]] conductor. [[Ether|Ether]] flows from positive to negative depending on the voltage. [[Ether|Ether]] has resistance and will cause heat build up, and eventual voltage decay. The amount of [[Ether|Ether]] the metal can handle without resisting and heating is equal to its grade.
Capacitors. 
	Won't produce [[Ether|Ether]], but will function as an [[Ether|Ether]] battery. [[Ether|Ether]] directed inside of it is held indefinitely. Will leak [[Ether|Ether]] if exposed to electricity. If the amount of [[Ether|Ether]] stored is above its grade, it melts.

**Other Alloys**
Non-Conductive Metals. 
	The Eathyst gains the physical properties of the metal.

### E-Tech
**The Basics**
	1. **Power Source.** An electrical charge passes into the power source (I.E. Eathyst), which then begins producing [[Ether|Ether]]. 
	2. **E-Conductor.** To prevent the [[Ether|Ether]] from erupting from the Eathyst, the [[Ether|Ether]] from the power source is moved into an [[Ether|Ether]] conductive alloy. The [[Ether|Ether]] will flow from positive to negative in the circuit.
	3. **Programmer**. The [[Ether|Ether]] is programmed via some replicable means.
	4. **Exit Point.** The [[Ether|Ether]] flows to its desired point, at which it begins to manifest. 

**Systems of Measurement**
1. Voltage. The amount of hypothetical pressure pushing the [[Ether|Ether]] to move through the circuit.
2. Amperage. The amount of [[Ether|Ether]] moving.
3. Wattage. The amperage multiplied by the voltage. Represents the amount of "power" you have to work with.
4. Grade (see [[Ether|Ether]] reference table). A shorthand method of denoting [[Ether|Ether]] quantity. Can be used to represent conductivity (I.E. how much [[Ether|Ether]] an alloy can handle), or also how much [[Ether|Ether]] a unit of Eathyst produces per hour.

**Methods of [[Ether|Ether]] Programming**
#1 Quantum Programming
	By making use of unprogrammed [[Ether|Ether]], you can manually reprogram it with a quantum supercomputer, and nothing less. This process is expensive, but it allows you to program very complex ideas.

#2 Ideological Programming
	Unprogrammed [[Ether|Ether]] conducts nearby concepts. This can be inconsistent unless the [[Ether|Ether]] directly contacts something containing the desired concept. There are a few major ways to do this. Engraving shorthand onto a series of layered E-Conductor plates is the industry standard, but a more archaic method involves attaching an [[Ether|Ether]] circuit to a book.



# BIG CHANGES TO CANONIZE
- You program [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] with "escript," which is a shorthand logical language akin to [[Galactic Standards|C]]#.
- [[Eathyst and E-Tech|E-Tech]] components. They let you program new spells functionally
	- Voltage. The range of the effect. The [[Ether]] pressure.
	- Amperage. The amount of [[Ether]]. The power source.
	- Charge. The idea the [[Ether]] conducts. The effect. Also changes to the effect.
