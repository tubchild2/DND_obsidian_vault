# The True Nature of Existence
### The Sleeper
Existence is sustained by the dream of an entity known as "The Sleeper" (unknown origin, purpose, or limitation). The Sleeper resides at the center of existence: it's an inaccessible liminal realm (see "realms"). If the Sleeper awakens, reality ceases to exist. 

**Stuff no one will ever know but it's a fun bit of lore.**
The Sleeper is a 7yr old boy from our world who's fallen asleep in class. It's unclear whether him falling asleep again will reignite the realms.

### The Realms
There are multiple planes of existence or "realms." They function as independent universes with their own laws of physics. The only constant is the flow of time, which emanates from the Sleeper in the center of existence. Realms are not the result of decisions made in the universe, but are created and serve their own intendent functions in the broader ethos of creation. Each realm has a property known as "enforcement." Enforcement is a measurement of how strict the laws of physics are. 
- **Physical (>75%).** A realm with very high enforcement. A traditional universe built of matter and energy. 
- **Fantastical (>50%).** A realm with medium enforcement. A mostly realistic universe with some [[Ether]]. The rules are flexible, but nonetheless firmly in-place. 
- **Liminal (>25%).** A realm with low enforcement. The laws of physics are almost irrelevant and existence is dream-like. The difference between imagination and reality is blurry. 
- **Abstract (>0%).** A realm with no enforcement. There are no laws of physics, as the realm is made of ideas represented by [[Ether]]. A realm of pure creation. 
### The Barrier
To prevent the realms from colliding, they're separated by a buffer known as the barrier. The barrier cannot be removed, as it is the glue that holds the realities together. The barrier has 2 major properties:
- **Tension.** A measurement of how much power (be it physical or abstract) it requires to puncture the barrier and create a [[Portals|gateway]].
- **Durability.** A measurement of how much damage the barrier can sustain before breaking. If the barrier receives too much damage, the individual [[Portals]] will begin to grow and rip open. If left unchecked, they'll shatter the barrier entirely.  Breaking the barrier causes the cataclysm (see "The Cataclysm"). 
### The Cataclysm
If the barrier is destroyed, the realms lose their separation and begin to pull into each other. Everything--physical or abstract--is deconstructed into its most basic form as the Sleeper reimagines the world. This event is known as the cataclysm, because almost everything in existence is completely destroyed (see "Key Items").
### The Reset and the Cycles
After the cataclysm, reality is reset. Thus begins a new "cycle." The reset recycles what came before, removes some things, and adds some others. The Sleeper then unconsciously creates a new barrier to sustain the realms. The new barrier very likely differs from the previous one, which greatly impacts how the cycle will unfold. 
### Key Items
Some items of immense abstract or physical power can become resistant to the cataclysm, allowing them to exist in all subsequent cycles. The only items capable of doing this are ones of either extreme [[Ether|Ether]] concentration, or extreme energy conservation.
