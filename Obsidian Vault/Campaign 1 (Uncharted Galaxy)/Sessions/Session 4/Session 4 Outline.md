Drawing Room description:
- You enter a private living room that's been emptied out. It's dirty and covered in wires and machine parts. At the far end lies [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]] hooked up to some kind of machine. It looks like it's charging.
- In front of it is a slouched figure with a complex crown made up of 20 horns. It's wearing a dark regal outfit, and is standing weakly in the distance, operating the machine.
- In front of him stands two [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Elite Dreadnaves]], ready to defend the machine with their lives. 
Combat Encounter #2
- [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] and 2 [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Elite Dreadnaves]] vs. [[The Party]]
- Win Condition: Defeat [[Primordial of Order|Tod]]
	- You suddenly hear typing coming from behind you. Turning around, you see a human man, about 6'4" with curly brown hair and a skinnier build sitting at a desk typing something. He sees you and falls backwards out of his chair. 
	- Aiden didn't think it was possible to be here so he's been using this moment as an office. 
	- He says, "Activate [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]]; you won't; no balls."
- Loss Condition: [[The Party]] Dies or [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]] activates.

### Loss
- Everyone leaves them alone to die, and [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]] is taken to another room.
- Play "The End of the World" Playlist
- [[Mano di Dio|The Mano di Dio]] activates and the roof is blown off by a chaotic surge of red energy revealing thousands of rippling red tears in space. The statue is consumed by the red energy, and the tears begin spreading rapidly across the horizon. You feel your body and mind begin to abstract and melt away as the structure of reality decomposes. You watch as the world around you shakes and begins melting into itself as unknowable shapes emerge from the tears.
- As the world decays around you, and the light fades, you feel enough life remaining to take one more turn each, but you know this is the end.
- Your bodies turn to dust. So does Dale, the hobgoblin shipwright, the arms dealer, the bouncer from the bar, the queen cockatrice, and everything else you encountered. Strangely, the Man in the suit that's been following you turns into a large white octopus thing before turning to dust. 
- That's where we'll leave it.
