Pre game
- Ensure everyone has their background, subclass, feat, and health fixed
- Health is calculated by rolling the hit die of your class a number of times equal to your level in it, then adding your constitution modifier multiplied by your level to the previous total. This gives you your new maximum hp. 
- Read out Mikhail's Behavior
- Read out [[Wyrm's Rest]] Mechanics

Pre game monologue:
- **LOWER EXPECTATIONS.** This session is going to be much more chill than the last few. But just as a reminder, if you die, you cannot be brought back by any means. Just... value your lives, because once your character dies you can't get them back. Not that you will be at any risk though, because once again this session is going to mostly safe. But after last session I felt like reminding you guys, there will be some fights you simply cannot win. 
- **SET UP CONFUSION.** Another standard reminder, if you want to do something in universe, whatever it is, I'll let you do it. You're guiding the story, not me. If you want to go somewhere, you can. 
- **RECAP.** Choose 5 people. Each person recaps a session.
	- Session 0: The Cabin
	- Session 1: The City (make sure to mention Dale!)
	- Session 1.1: Xavi's Heist One Shot
	- Session 1.2: Xavi's Slavery One Shot
	- Session 2: The Wilderness of [[Vivimus]]

##### **BASIC CONTENT**:
- Exploring [[Wyrm's Rest]]. 
- They're also wanted by [[House Galling]] for multiple counts of murder, theft, possession of illegal substances, and a whole lot of other things. They one they're really stressing is that they went on the surface without a permit. That's what they think is the most important. [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Inquisitors]] will likely apprehend them if they do too much.

- They're interrogated by the supervisor about what they've been up to. They're wanted for murder, theft, possession of illicit substances, and especially for going onto the surface without a permit. 
- Split the players up and ask them what they were doing on the surface and why. Try to split them up by saying that people were saying bad things about each other. 

Phase 3: On the run

	- (If they see him) 
		- Heâ€™s dressed in a cold, weathered brown leather outfit, stained with dirt and blood, and draped in a tattered red cloak that flaps against the wind like a banner of death. His face is hidden beneath a brass skull-like mask, the hollow eyes glowing with a small, beady red light that seems to burn through the haze. His wide-brimmed hat further obscured his gaze.
