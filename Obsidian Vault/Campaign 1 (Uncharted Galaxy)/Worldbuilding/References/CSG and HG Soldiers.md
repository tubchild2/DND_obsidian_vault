### Individual Units
**Inquisitors**
	Creatures bred for their speed and numbers. They're genetically engineered and are born in pits. They have no faces, are 8ft tall, have disproportionately large hands and appendages, and they can run, swim, and climb extremely fast. They move like the death angels from a quiet place. Their hands are the size of their torsos.

**Enforcers**

**Dreadnaves ([[Federation]])**

	They received a 20% concentration dreadnave serum.
	9ft tall.

**Dreadnave Serum**
	A serum that granted the Dreadnaves additional organs, rapid healing, and enhanced physical abilities. 
	The amount of serum is represented as a percentage (concentration), with the rest of it being alcohol.
	Higher volumes and concentrations of the serum tend to produce more genetic aberrations, and can be inconsistent. 
	Taking multiple injections changes your concentration. Use this [[Formulas|formula]]:
 
$$
C_n = \frac {(C_1*Ml_1) + (C_2 *Ml_2)} {Ml_1+Ml_2}
$$
> [!Using This Formula]
> **C₁**: Current concentration in your body.
> **Ml₁**: Amount of fluid currently in your body. 
> **C₂**: Concentration of the new injection.
> **Ml₂**: Volume of the new injection.
> **Cₙ**: New concentration after the injection

**Dreadnaves ([[House Galling]])**

	10ft tall.

**Pundit**
	A lab grown creature with increased intelligence. They're frail specialists, and typically work as engineers, medics, and advisors. They do not do grunt work, as that is reserved for the [[Illeth]]. They simply design and plan unless their role requires their intervention. 
	They're horribly deformed, and their skin is sensitive to radiation, even from the sun, so they choose to wear full helmets and coverings. 
	They're typically around 4-5ft tall.

---
**Elite Dreadnave**
	A combination Pundit and Dreadnave. They're bred to be leaders of dreadnave battalions.
	They're given a 40% concentration dreadnave serum, making them rare due to the initial poisoning this incurs. 
	Given [[Exotic Metals|Illidium]] power armor.
	11ft tall.
