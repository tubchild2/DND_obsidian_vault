### Lore and Roleplay
**Personality**
- **Mysterious.** He keeps his cards close to his chest to prevent any insurrection. 
- **Unpredictable.** He's more intelligent than you, and his plans are beyond your understanding. 
- **Very High Above You.** He doesn't respect anyone, and sees himself as a god. The power difference between him and anyone around him is staggering.
- **Intelligent.** His thesis is "order" which is an abstract, constructed idea that's unnatural. He's definitely a [[Primordials|complex primordial]] granting him remarkable intelligence. He knows every thought that's ever been thought about order.
- **Dangerous.** He can and will kill you at a moment's notice if you threaten his authority.
- **Manipulative.** He's a master chess player. He can and will lie and cheat to ensure his victory is absolute. He doesn't even need to, since he's an excellent strategist. He delegates to an order of followers he has absolute control over. 

**Backstory**
Prehistory
- Came to being when life starting thinking about order.
- The de facto leader of the [[Primordials|primordial]]. They listened to him in the field whenever he encountered them.

10020
- Tod was following a strange phenomenon happening around a random moving point in [[Mythraama]]. When it unexpectedly opened a [[Portals|gateway]], he formed a [[Primordials|Theophany]] and flew away to investigate the brand new world he found himself in, and to discover what had happened.
- He began formulating a plan to conquer everything right off the bat. However, while investigating the place he formed in, he discovered the [[Tessali]]. The two briefly talked, but Tod quickly felt the presence of [[The Chronicle of the Sleeper]]. After removing it from the [[Tessali]] and reading, it became clear where he'd gone to, and what his goal was. 
- He then realized how little [[Ether]] was in this [[The True Nature of Existence|realm]]. He considered going back, but he was permanently stuck. So, he began eating people's thoughts. They produce next to no [[Ether]], so he was perpetually famished. 
- Late at night, he appeared outside [[Bradford]]'s bedroom door. He woke him up, and the two had a private conversation. Tod told [[Bradford]] that he was an angel, and that he needed [[Bradford]]'s help. 
- Tod said that he'd make the world a better place. With his abilities, he could make a world with no stress, no unfair treatment, no nothing! No one would ever suffer. He'd tear down the current systems and make a new one in which culture and life would flourish. He just needs [[Bradford]]'s [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]]. Actually, all of [[Bradford]]'s [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]]. [[Bradford]]'s faith was unshakable, so he agreed. 

10024
- [[Mano di Dio|The Mano di Dio]] (the key ingredient in making a larger [[Portals|gateway]]) was stolen by [[Pluto]]. With no way to produce [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] without the [[Tessali]] (which was also stolen), Tod's plans were ruined. He became furious with [[Bradford]]. He'd keep him alive until he recovered the statue. In the meantime, Tod would grow in power to make himself a [[The True Nature of Existence|Key Item]]. 

12024
	He's spent 2000 years forcing [[Bradford]] to comb [[The Galaxy]] for [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]].

**Agenda**
1. Become as powerful as physically possible to become a [[The True Nature of Existence|Key Item]]. 
2. Use [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] to open as many [[Portals]] as possible. Doing this would also mean he'd have a higher chance of surviving, since he's constantly hungry in the universe and he'd like at least a means of travel back to [[Mythraama]]. 
3. Cause and survive [[The True Nature of Existence|the cataclysm]], and rebuild the new cycle from the ground up.
4. Bring about an ultimate order.

**Appearance**
- A being made of smoky black tendrils.
- Wears gold and black armor with organic designs. 
- Wears a long red cape that turns to smoke at its ends.
- Wears a helmet with a white face plate with 4 ripped holes in it, and a golden crown with horns and holes in it.
- Stands at 9'1"
- Sprouts organic, thorny, black, spider-legs with a gold trim. He uses them when he needs them. They emit black smoky tendrils.
