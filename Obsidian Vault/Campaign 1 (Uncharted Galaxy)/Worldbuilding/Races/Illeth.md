They're built to live on the surface of [[Vivimus]], a toxic, volcanic wasteland. They have thick skin, giving them resistance to poison, fire, and parasites. They're quiet and nimble, observant due to their large black eyes, and excellent scavengers. Their long grey tails are extremely versatile, though not the most precise. 

### History
Prehistory
	They're the native creatures of [[Vivimus]]. Their empire spanned the [[Gorviris]], [[Viviris]], [[Veldiris]], [[Thaldriss]], [[Beholder's Reach]], and [[Grey Mire]] regions. Their capital was [[Carrion Well]], which was beneath [[Carrion Keep]] in [[Gorviris]], which was protected by [[Gorviris|Archer's Pass]]. 
	Witnessed the [[Tessali]]. They never came to a consensus as to what it was. The called it "The Watcher."

	The [[Fernites|Fernite]] infestation led to rampant geothermal and mutant activity. Their skin was thick enough to resist [[Fernites|Fernite]] infection, and they adapted to the new geological formations and mutant attacks quite well. They increased their military capabilities, which is especially notable in the construction of [[Gorviris|Fennhollow]] outside of [[Gorviris|Mistriven]]. 
	On the bright side, exposure to humans allowed them to improve their written texts, with the creation of [[Illish]]. [[Illish]] is a written script derived from English that uses Illeth characters.

7105-7107
	[[House Galling]] arrived on the planet and established [[Vivere Mori]] as a religious mining colony. Relations were good until 7017.
	[[House Galling]] attempted to purchase their land, but the Illeth refused. Over the next few years, relations with [[House Galling]] worsened, until communication was completely cut. 

7171 (Written by a scribe at [[Carrion Well]] during the battle of [[Archer's Pass]])
- The attack was unprompted. At dawn, a deafening silence hung over the Illeth lands, only to be shattered by the sound of monstrous war cries. The Illeth, though accustomed to surviving the harsh volcanic terrain and mutants, were unprepared for the sheer horror that descended upon them.
- Out of the mists the **[[CSG and HG Soldiers|Inquisitors]]** emerged. They were not humanâ€”tall, hulking monstrosities with grotesque, featureless faces and limbs too long for their twisted forms. Their regal robes bore the marks of **[[House Galling]]**, but their movements were mechanical, mindless, driven by an unrelenting, singular purpose: destruction. They moved like a tide, endless and unyielding, crushing everything in their path.
- The first day of the invasion was a bloodbath. Entire cities fell in hours, their defenses overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Inquisitors]]. **[[Grey Mire|Saltspire]]**, **[[Gorviris|Mistriven]]**, **[[Veldiris|Veldhelm]]**, **[[Gorviris]]**, and **[[Thaldriss]]** were reduced to ruins before the sun set. Villages were razed, families torn apart, and survivors driven into the wilderness. The Illeth fought valiantly, but their weapons barely slowed the onslaught. The [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Inquisitors]] advanced, immune to fear or fatigue.
- I write this now from the hidden library in [[Carrion Keep]]. For three nights the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Inquisitors]] have raged [[Archer's Pass]], attempting to break through into the city. Our soldiers are tired, hungry, and we're running low on supplies. We've slain thousands, but each night their raids intensify. We cannot hold here for much longer. The king weeps during the day when he thinks no one is around. It's dusk now, and they'll be upon us any minute. We have naught to do but pray. 

By nightfall, a horde of [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Inquisitors]] unlike any before stormed [[Archer's Pass]]. They took the Illeth families away to the mines of [[Gorviris]], and the [[Grey Mire|Inquisitor Pits]] of [[Grey Mire|Butte Galling]]. They were housed in small dirt pits covered by tarps. Any rebels, apostates, or escapees were publicly executed by the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Inquisitors]].

	The Illeth recovered enough to form a small rebellion called the [[Heretics]]. This original group worked with Emily Galling ([[Bradford]]'s Wife) to get enough insider information to allow [[Pluto]] to steal [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]] and ruin [[House Galling]] / [[Bradford]] / the [[Armstrong Initiative]] / the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|Church of Saint Galling]]'s plans. This was unfortunately short-lived, as just 59 years later, the organization collapses due to in-fighting, and it ends in a bloodbath.

	The Illeth are common slaves. They're servants at [[Grey Mire|Butte Galling]], miners in the [[Gorviris|great mines of Gorviris]], they transport metals, do grunt work in the city / on the battle field, and other physical labor. 
	The [[Heretics]] are reforming under the lead of [[Heretics|Siff Grax]]. Over time, small groups of Illeth escaped and began living in a camp north of [[Viviris]] called [[Heretics|Ollin Hill]]. [[Heretics|Siff]] is forming a rebellion against the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] and [[House Galling]]. He plans to draw the attention of the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Dreadnaves]] away from the mountains, then muster a force to overpower the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|inquisitors]] and free the Illeth in the [[Gorviris|great mines of Gorviris]].
