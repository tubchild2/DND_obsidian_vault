**General Information**
- Abstract creatures native to [[Mythraama]].
- Extremely [[Ether]] potent, due to being Abstract and made of [[Ether]]. 
- Primordials think each other into existence.
- Each Primordial represents a given concept (or thesis). Their bodies are made of [[Ether]], with each particle storing potential petabytes of information. Their thesis is the sum total of all of it. It's decided at birth and cannot be changed due to ideological magnetism (see [[Ether]]). 
- Primordials can consume [[Ether]] and add it to their bodies, allowing them to grow in [[Ether]]-potency and power. However, they can only consume [[Ether]] related to their Thesis due to ideological magnetism (see [[Ether]]). They don't need to do this unless they enter a [[The True Nature of Existence|realm]] in which their [[Ether]] began manifesting and they suddenly need a constant supply. 

**Classifications of Primordials**
- Archaic Theses. Ancient, primal, and simple theses yield primordials with unfathomable [[Ether]]-potency, but they're much less intelligent. They perform their function and consume vast amounts of [[Ether]]. Some are functionally braindead, unaware of their own existence, and are reduced to nothing but simple algorithms.  
- Complex Theses. Theses that are abstract, nuanced, and unnatural yield primordials with lower [[Ether]]-potency, but vast intelligence.
