In 6680, the nations of earth combined into one central force following WWXI. They represent and oversee all human and halfling governments with absolute control. 

In 7070, two unknown aliens land on earth. The Federation quickly apprehended and interrogated them. They inform humans that they're the bottom of the food chain, and that [[The Galaxy]] is teeming with advanced, dangerous life. They hijack their ships and kill the aliens. 

In 7070, a large object was detected on the far reaches of Sol. The object--roughly a third of the size of Earth's moon--followed no regular orbit and seemed to be moving towards Earth. A few days later, alien lifeforms silently began invading homes. The Federation responded too late, and millions died overnight. They nuked the object in space and captured a few of the invaders. After heavy interrogation, they learned that--not only were humans not alone--but they weren't even close to the top of the food chain. Out of fear, they greenlight the [[Armstrong Initiative]] to make humans genetically superior to their alien counterparts. They have 3 projects within the initiative. They wanted a highly adaptable bioweapon they could deploy on planets (see the [[Fernites]]), they wanted soldiers capable of fighting alien life (see the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Dreadnaves]]), and the wanted to generally make humanity more powerful. The [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Dreadnaves]] were a success, the [[Fernites]] ruined a planet, and they never got anywhere with the third project.
### Rules and Regulations
- The Federation represents the collective ruling of humankind, therefore it is of the utmost importance that all legal, pure-blooded humans living in Federation territory must fill out their annual surveys. Failure to comply will result in legal action, and or deportation, as this data provides the backbone of their decision making process. 
- If a resident of a Federation owned territory passes away and they don't have an inheritance established, their belongings will be repossessed by the Federation. Legal entities cannot be inherited. 
- Houses are families that have contracts with the Federation that allow them to flex their rulings under certain circumstances. They're typically in control of large businesses, religions, territories, or other groups with large influence. This contract allows you establish an inheritance of a complex legal entity, manage and own territory as an extension of the Federation instead of directly under them, etc. 
- Additional human ruled planets, space stations, orbital bodies, etc. must be declared as houses according to their structure of government to act as extensions of the Federation, and to receive Federation funding and support. 
- Governments on house controlled human bodies are free to create and enforce their own Governments in compliance with Federation rulings. Failure to comply will result in losing Federation support, or in extreme cases, military intervention. 
- All Federation decisions must be made by a council with representatives from all houses of 15,000 citizens or more. The council meets annually, and failure to arrive (or to send a representative) will result in swift legal action, potentially resulting in loss of power.
- In the case of a militarized conflict arising between the Federation as a whole and another kingdom of 1,000,000 residents or more, all drafted Houses are required to provide access to their complete military for immediate deployment.
