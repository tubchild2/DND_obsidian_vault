### Primary Territories
- Malfaust. A wildly varied planet akin to earth.
	- Acrius. A continent home to the black, copper, and green dragons / dragonborn. Masters of chemical refinery and bioengineering. Regional radiation pockets and toxic chemicals make travelling the lands difficult.
	- Straticus. A series of isles home to the blue and bronze dragons / dragonborn. Constant storms blanket the archipelago due to the influence of the native dragons. Fishing is extremely important here. The islands are small, so they expanded onto the ocean Kamino style. It's a clan of pirates, and Straticus is their haven. 
	- Articus. A frigid continent home to the silver and white dragons / dragonborn. Greenland esc climate with more mountains. Located far to the north.
	- Thunor. A volcanic region home to the brass, gold, and red dragons / dragonborn. You can't grow anything here, but the earth is rich in metals and minerals. Geothermic activity is constant. Grows Emberthorn, Spike Roots, and Argent Kapok Trees
