Ambience:
- The [[Vivimus]] Ambience Playlist

**General Description**
- (If you're coming from the bunker) You rush out of the large steel door.
- (If you're coming from the hatch) You climb down and down for like 20 minutes before you reach the bottom. You're standing on a ledge, and there's a giant steel door to your right, but it looks deactivated. 
	Stepping out into the caverns, you're met with a vast opening, and a wave of humid air. The caverns are immense, stretching down and further than you can grasp. In the distance, the slick purple stone is unearthed by towering red-root monoliths that pierce the ceiling. Their scale is impossible, and absolute. You follow a staircase down into the caverns, constantly tracking the coordinates to ensure you're on track. The deeper you go, the more you notice a certain rhythm to the caverns. A low rhythmic beat sounds through the walls, the sprawling red roots swell like arteries, and the tunnels seem to constrict as you pass through them. You continue following the path over vast ravines complimented by the wail of creatures unknown. The [[Fernites]] were an insult to nature: they were meant to rip ecosystems apart... and yet they've formed an ecosystem unlike anything else in [[The Galaxy]]. Following the low beeping of your [[Item Catalogue|exosuit]], you hike a quarter mile off course, arrive just a few feet from the coordinates supposed location. A chalky red boulder blocks your path. What do you do? 

- (Moving the rock)
	- You find a hand-carved stone door.
		- (if not done earlier) Could I get a perception check?
			- You know that feeling you get when you're home alone, and you see a door closed with the light on? Or when you get home after a long day and notice something moved. It's not a thought, it's more primal than that. It's an awareness. You can feel someone there, just out of sight. It's instinct: primal anxiety. With no evidence, no reason, no logic, you feel there's someone on the other side. 


**[[Wyrm's Rest]] Trial**
Room 1
	You step into a small hand-carved room. In it lies a single small golden chest on a table, and a sealed door on the opposite side of the room. Below the table the chest sits on is an extremely deep pit. You can't see the bottom. 
		- (inside the chest is [[Pluto]]'s second letter)
		- (the pit requires a sacrifice of an item of immense personal value to progress)

Room 2
	Moving through the door, you find yourselves in awe of the 24 square foot statue of pure [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]]. It's perfectly made, and has no damage to it. It has a shiny purple metallic finish, and weighs next to nothing for something of its size. It's in PERFECT condition. Piled around it is a bunch of loot. 
		- Loot. (DC5 investigation)
			- 5,000[[Galactic Standards|c]] in a brown leather pouch. 
			- Necklace string of small pink pearls. 25 [[Galactic Standards|gp]] (2,500[[Galactic Standards|c]]) 
			- Emerald in a chest. 10 [[Galactic Standards|gp]] (1,000[[Galactic Standards|c]]) 
			- Spiked [[Exotic Metals|Ravite]] Shield. +2 AC, but you can't use two-handed weapons. As an action or bonus action, you can shield bash an enemy for 1d6 bludgeoning. If you were hit after the start of the previous round, you deal 2d8 fire damage instead.
			- Studded Leather Armor. 12 + DEX
			- Scale Mail. AC = 14 + DEX (max 2)
			- [[Exotic Metals|Illidium]] Warhammer. Deals 3d8 Bludgeoning Damage. Heavy (16+). Two-Handed.

**[[Pluto]]'s Second Note**
Dear Traveler,

The work you’ve put in to earn a chance at what I’m offering is worthy of praise, but that alone won’t get you the statue. The quest I’m about to offer you demands nothing but absolute selflessness. It’s not an exaggeration to say that the fate of our reality lies in the balance.

When I stole the Mano Di Dio from House Galling, I was ignorant to its true nature, and it cost me everything. Owning this statue has bound me to a life on the run from House Galling, a life of sworn secrecy, a life of loneliness. House Galling took my family because of what I took. I’m not saying that will happen to you but know that carrying something of this importance has consequences.

I understand the irritation that must come with not knowing what the statue is better than anyone. However, that’d be akin to offering you a nuclear bomb with an instruction manual. It’s not a WMD, but it is dangerous.

With all of that said, I offer the following quest: destroy the Mano di Dio. I don’t mean hide it, I don’t mean sell it, and I don’t mean damage it beyond repair. Any molecule of Nethrium left in existence puts you and I at risk of utter annihilation. I’ve spent 40 years looking for a means to destroy it, but the technology just doesn’t exist in my time.

Unfortunately, there’s no way for me to stop you from selling the statue or giving it back to House Galling. So, as compensation for your cooperation, you’ll receive a small fortune.

The trial itself is simple. The room contains a pit and a door. To open the door, you need to prove your dedication by hurling an item of great personal value into the pit. The trial will test your resolve, but if you succeed, the _Mano di Dio_ will be yours, and so too will the fate of our reality be in your hands.
