### General Information
- Located on [[Vivimus]], in the [[Beholder's Reach]] region. Connects [[Fennhollow Pass|Fennhollow]] pass to [[Beholder's Reach|Wyrm's Rest]]. 
- Used to be an [[Illeth]] Settlement, but was destroyed due to the volcanic activity caused by the [[Fernites]]. 
- Nothing but hazy, charred, molten ruins.
- The [[Illeth]] here were turned to statues by the Queen Cockatrice, which is native to [[Fennhollow Pass]]. 

### Location Descriptions
**Exiting [[Fennhollow Pass]]**
	Walking through the tunnel, you begin to feel the air heat up around you. The fog turns from steam to ash, and the air begins to feel drier.

**Opening Description**
- Stepping out into the charred and cracked land, you're greeted by an otherworldly sight. An expand of molten lava stretches far into the distance. The remains of a now burnt city lie scattered among the crags--arches and bridges now lopsided and half-melted. A series of bridges linking the dark rock (while burnt) allow passage to [[Wyrm's Rest]]. 
- The air is thick with ash, and as you look to the sky, you notice that it's now starting to become night. The second sun begins to rise over the horizon, lending a soft purple glow to the skies above. 
- As the sky darkens, you begin to feel exhausted. Not just from the heat, but from the long day you've had. You yawn, and look over to your right and jump back from shock. Standing there is a short alien creature with large eyes and a tail, reaching out with a look of absolute horror, turned to ash. 
- What do you do?

**Obstacle 1**
- You carefully tread onto stone bridges, and walk out onto the lava lake. 
- You pass through arches, completely collapsed buildings, and find more solidified creatures. 
- However, about halfway across the lake, you reach a large bridge that's crumbled in the center, leaving several medium sized holes. The remnants of an [[Illeth]] caravan litter the edge—skeletal remains and overturned wagons hint at their attempted escape. A few more statues stand around the holes, their faces completely emotionless
- What do you do?
	- Investigating the statues causes Magma Mephits to pop out.

**Cathedral**
- Ahead of you sits a grand gothic cathedral, its towering spires and intricate stonework now half-submerged in the relentless flow of molten lava. The air around it hums with an oppressive heat, and the smell of sulfur fills your nostrils.
- Inside
	- The remnants of [[Illeth]] citizens are frozen in their final moments, their bodies reduced to fragile ashen sculptures. Some kneel in prayer before a shattered shrine, their hands clasped tightly as if pleading for salvation. Others are half-buried in cooled magma, faces twisted in silent screams or gazes locked in horrified disbelief at the encroaching destruction. A few cover their heads in desperation, their forms captured in eerie, tragic stillness.
	- Near the cathedral's entrance, you notice the remnants of a small campsite, likely left behind by travelers who once braved these lands. The charred skeletons of the camp’s occupants are still present, slumped near a crude fire pit. Around them, faint cockatrice footprints are pressed into the soot-covered ground, an unsettling reminder that this place remains far from safe. The decayed remains of tents and supplies lie scattered about, offering only fragments of a story lost to time.
