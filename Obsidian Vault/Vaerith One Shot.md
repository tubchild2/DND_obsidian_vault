**Setup**
They will meet at a tavern in Northern [[Vaerith]] to the east of Watcher's Bluff as a thieving crew. There, they'll receive a tip about a shipwreck that supposedly contains a large amount of forgotten lost gold from centuries ago. 

The shipwreck is in a cove past some foggy highlands in Archer's Glade. Upon arriving there, they realize that the gold was intercepted by the temple owners of Watcher's Bluff.

After passing through a collapsed mine, they arrive at a Tibetan inspired temple amidst a blizzard.
