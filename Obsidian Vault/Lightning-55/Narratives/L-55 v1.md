Setting: Ancient East-Asia + Sci-Fi
- Our solar system was terraformed and colonized by the Sultanate. They terraformed the planets with "obelisks," massive stone pillars that jut out from the north and south poles of terraformed planets. The Sultanate is commanded by the Sultan, and he oversees the Great Houses. They all reside on Earth. There are 20 or so Houses, and they each oversee massive corporations important to the Sultan.
- On Europa, a moon of Jupiter, a disease known as 'bane' broke out. It attacks cellular mitosis, and causes tumors, cysts, bone deformities, and blood clots to grow. This is incredibly taxing on your body, causing severe exhaustion, pain, and hunger. It takes 2 months to kill you, leading many to madness. It's an airborne and bloodborne virus. A vial of infected blood guarantees death to whomever it touches, and just being in the presence of an infected one puts you in grave danger. 
- Bane spread throughout the solar system, wiping out 80% of the system's population, leaving not enough supplies and infrastructure to support the new colonies. No one native to Europa survived the outbreak, and it's now a ghost moon that no one dares visit.
- The Federation capital Tokyo and other House controlled earth cities maintained their opulence, but the rest of the worlds saw mass starvation and strife. They reverted back to Feudal Japan and formed independent governments. The Federation is fighting to regain control by use of their military, leading to violent occupation.
- The Rebels against the Federation are even more dangerous than the Federation is. They make use of improvised weapons, the environment, and traps. They hate the Federation and blame them for the outbreak.
- Bane is still dangerous, but it's rarer. Since there's no cure, the infected are often separated, leading to the formation of Bane camps, places of madness and suffering. Bane camps are incredibly dangerous due to Bane, but also due to the potential of the infected purposefully infecting or killing you. If you see someone that has Bane, it's likely too late. 
- Like in Clone Wars, neither side is correct. Whether you side with the Rebels, or with the Sultanate, you're wrong. The Sultanate is incredibly corrupt due to some of the Houses greatly profiting from the scarcity of resources and the conflict. They fight for control over the territories because some what unity in the system, and others fight just to continue the conflict. None of the Sultanate wants the planets to be independent, so they occupy with their militaries and try to foster dependence in any way they can. They sometimes knock down entire villages and replace them with their own. The Rebels on the other hand, fight for independence yes, but they also prevent unity and cause several towns to endure severe hardship without the support of the Sultanate.
- For everyone else just trying to get by, you need to get paid to attempt to afford food. This typically means working for the Sultanate, but you don't have to. Money is scarce, and resources scarcer. People are willing to cross lines if it means survival. Many have resorted to farming and fishing to attempt to become self-sufficient once more.
- The Sultanate are the only ones that can afford modern firearms and explosives. Muskets, flintlocks, smoke bombs, and cannons are the next step down, but they're rare and expensive. Katanas, Naginatas, Bows, Shurikens, and Tontos are by far the most common weapons. 
- Myths have been circulating about a creature that exists in deep space. Whenever it approaches, all sensors and windows go black, preventing seeing it. Whatever it is, it's incredibly powerful and capable of overriding and controlling all technology it interacts with. It is simply known as the Beast. It seems to only attack bad people, and when it attacks, they disappear entirely. No one has ever seen it, and few that have been near it have survived. There isn't just one either, unknowables exist throughout deep space. (they can't see them yet, but they look like southeast Asian mythological entities) They're forces of nature with no motives of any kind.
- Written text appears as Japanese Kanji, and Japanese words are incorporated into their language.

Premise:
- The story follows the crew of the Lightning-55, a cheap, barely functional, and heavily damaged ship. They don't have much money. They're bounty hunters, a well-paying but dangerous line of work. They complete bounties for both sides, and often for third parties. They have to travel to and visit remote villages, cities, ruins, ships, and wilds to hunt down the scum of the system.
- The crew is largely desensitized and selfish. They're no longer innocent, and they don't care about what's "right" or "wrong" anymore.
- The Crew of the Lightning-55 accept a suspicious job from the Cult of Tian Jiao. They're highly secretive, and informed them that some of their property has been stolen by a high ranking member of House Yami. They need to find it and return it to them. If they look at what it is, they violate their contract and will be executed. The Cultists worship the beasts of deep space and are incredibly powerful. They complete the job, and accidentally open the stolen container. Inside is a deep-space beast in the flesh, a small one. It's unclear how they even captured one, as it's the first one to even be seen.

Plot:
- The Cult worships the creature and have been bleeding it for some of their rituals. However, House Yami stole it. They discovered that the beast, which the crew names Fudo, is immune to Bane. They're going to kill it to develop a cure, and then monopolize it to make billions. Now that the crew saw Fudo, Tian Jiao now wants them dead. They decide not to return Fudo to the Cult because A, they really like it, and B, it'd be in danger. They don't understand fully what it is, but it likes them and is about twice as strong as a polar bear despite being half the size and flying.
- House Yami and the Cult of Tian Jiao were expected, but way more people are after them than they thought. House Kamui wants to kill Fudo to prevent a cure from existing because the scarcity of resources and people makes them richer. The Sultanate already dislikes bounty hunters, but they're symbols of rebellion and insurrection to their control, especially now. House Ushiki wants Fudo for military applications. Even the Rebels are against the crew; they want to kill Fudo to get the cure for themselves and then infect the sultanate with Bane. Every Bane Camp, or people closely associated with those infected by Bane, don't care about Fudo and are working with House Yami or the Rebels to get a cure as fast as possible. House Yori wants Mita back. Finally House Kaga will take advantage of whoever to try and enslave them.
- Their decision not the return Fudo causes more problems than they realize. As previously mentioned, their possession of Fudo causes them to become a target for pretty much every major group in the system. They need to avoid major planets and moons, evade the several groups after them, complete bounties to stay on the move, prevent their crew from falling apart due to disagreements about the situation, and find a way to get the cure out of Fudo without killing it. Their whole motivation for protecting an endangered species and being good makes them greatly stand out in the world, as being good isn't the norm. 
- There are multiple major mysteries unfolded over the course of the story. We learn that Fudo is a beast, a type of alien/spirit thing that used to be men, but were left adrift in space, and mutated over the course of centuries by cosmic radiation. We also learn that Bane was created by the Sultanate by mutating multiple diseases together to try and develop more powerful antibiotics. They did a bad job containing it, and it got out and wrought havoc. They need antibodies from something stronger in order to counteract it, but human bodies simply aren't capable of naturally fighting a disease like that off. Over the course of the story, we also learn more about each character's backstories and why they are who they are today, and how they joined the Lightning-55. We also learn the motives of each of the opposing forces.
- They manage to barely get through. They're kidnapped, separated, shot down, wounded, and broken down mentally, but they discover a third party willing to develop the cure without killing Fudo. The reason no one wants to do it is because it requires incredibly expensive chemicals that can only be found on earth and are completely controlled by the Sultanate. They have to go to earth and rob the Sultan, a task that's so impossibly stupid and hard that they all almost die. They then have to protect the third party while they work, and then get the cure to someone willing to distribute it cheaply and not take advantage of the situation. This proves much harder, as all of the major players arrive and attempt to steal the cure and/or Fudo. The crew comes out on top and gets the cure shipped out to 30 different planets and moons. Some of them die during this climax, but most of them survive. They go out as heroes. 
- The cure makes life a million times easier. Resources can be distributed more efficiently, several houses' corruption is discovered and weeded out, and the rebellion dies down under the rule of the new sultan. Things aren't perfect, but they're much, much, much better.

Crew:
- The Leader + Tracker. Wade Kyou. Cares about protecting his crew, so he'll do the wrong thing if it means keeping them healthy and happy. He'll steal, kill, and lie to get money for his group. His sense of morality is heavily skewed due to fear of losing what is essentially his family. He's a good person on the inside, but he's fine being the bad guy sometimes. Wields old twin revolvers that he stole on his first job. They're probably the most valuable thing he owns but he won't give them up for anything. He's kind of a tool. Nathan Drake + Malcolm Reynolds inspiration. His greatest strength is his ability to think quickly and talk. Lost his family to Bane, and has been a scoundrel for some time now. He owns Lightning-55, and is very experienced talking to low-lives and surviving in the wilds. He's got street smarts. Elected to keep Fudo, but second guesses the decision constantly.
- The Cook + Heart. Carter Hayes. Incredibly stupid comic relief character. He's incredibly empathetic, helpful, and kind. He grew up as a farmer and so he loves animals. He works aboard the Lightning-55 as the cook. Was kicked out of school. He will stand up to anyone and anything because he views his life as a disappointment, and he'd gladly give up what he has for others. His arc is about developing independence and self-worth as pretty much the crew's caretaker and the ship's protector. Charlie Kelly if he followed the Golden Rule / had a code. Loves Fudo and is the one primarily taking care of him. He treats Fudo as an equal.
- The Fighter + Foil. Kael Carmack. Wields a Katana and a Tanto. A simple person. Cares about food, women, and violence. He's what happens when you boil down all of the worst desires a man has. He may be stupid, aggressive, and naïve, but the good news is, he's experienced and loyal to Wade. Due to his simplistic and black and white view of situations, he'll often take the selfish way out. He's crude, rude, and has few redeeming qualities. He has a soft side that's incredibly easy to access because he loves music and will talk about it for hours. Doesn't want to keep Fudo, and actively resists it because it feels like an unnecessary risk.
- The Mechanic + Thief. Mita Yori. Cannot talk to people to save her life. Incredibly awkward, shy, and cowardly. Prefers to do things quietly and with precision. Doesn't talk much or get involved in ship affairs. She's riding along for the pay and loyalty. She and Carter are also interested in one another, although, unfortunately, neither has the emotional intelligence to communicate this to each other. She takes care of the ship and keeps it running. Book smart. Came from heavy abuse and has difficulties being social. Unless she's drunk then she's normal and has a bunch of weird party trick skills she picked up over the years. Has a creepy little bond with Fudo.
- The Medic + Veteran + Coward. Kudo Ko. An older gentlemen. He enjoys reading and playing the Theremin. Thinks of Mita as his own daughter ever since he lost his. He's an experienced doctor and researcher. He's getting older, and he's very scared of death. He has heart issues, and he becomes incredibly anxious at most things. Cowardly, and prefers the safer more precise route with more planning every time. Book smart. Lived recklessly until he was 40ish, then he lost his leg. He got his medical license and calmed down. He'd still be capable with a sword if he could afford a prosthetic leg. He's very skilled with tactical thinking and a pistol. He's not as clever as Wade, and not as good at shooting, but his book smarts let him make traps and outthink his opponents. Though, once again, he hates combat and prefers to slow, trap, and avoid his opponents rather than engaging them head on. Likes Fudo but doesn't want to be the ones burdened with dealing with it.
- The Pet + Wildcard. Fudo is a beast, and his genealogy is unknown. Though incapable of speaking, and mentally limited, Fudo carries a wide arsenal of abilities that make it incredibly powerful. First of all, it packs twice the power of a polar bear into a body the size of a lemur. It can also change its shape and color, though it cannot go beyond a rough 2ft-ish cube. Like the Beast, it can manipulate technology to do whatever it wants. It can additionally read thoughts, and manipulate dreams. It acts largely on instinct, but it's much smarter than it looks. If it wasn't so dang nice, you'd think it was a horror monster. It lurks around the ship, avoiding being seen, and hiding in darkness. It scares people constantly, and due to the way it reacts, you'd think it's almost proud of it. Though unintentionally scary, it's quite a nice creature that really only wants to help people. It's only really limited by its wounds, lack of emotional / social intelligence, and lack of boundaries. It's the ship's guard dog, and it occasionally shows its capabilities in gruesome ways that makes Kael and Kudo question whether it's a liability or not. Fudo looks like an entirely black mass with legs that can shapeshift. The only thing that remains consistent it its mask, which looks like an Oni. Though typically preferring to be quiet, it can be caught stealthily listening to traditional Japanese music.
