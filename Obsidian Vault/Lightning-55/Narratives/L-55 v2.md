Part 1: 
- We see the Lightning-55, a cheap, collapsing, damaged gunship used by a group of bounty hunters. The work is dangerous, but well-paying. 
- The Lightning-55 has a man crew; Captain Wade Kyou, Chef Carter Hayes, Sergeant Kael Carmack, Technician and Thief Mita Yori, and Doctor Asahi Ko.

- The crew receives a suspicious job from the Cult of Tian Jiao. They're highly secretive, and informed them that some of their property has been stolen by a high ranking member of House Yami. They need to find it and return it to them. If they look at what it is, they violate their contract and will be executed. The Cultists worship The Famine and are incredibly wealthy. The crew completes the job, and accidentally opens the stolen container. Inside is a deep-space beast in the flesh, a small one. It's unclear how the cult even captured one.

Part 2: Fudo
- It appears the Cult has been worshipping the creature (which Carter names Fudo) and have been bleeding it. Once the Cult finds out that they saw Fudo, they're going to try and kill them. 
- However, House Yami stole it and have been attempting to use its immunity to Bane to develop a cure, but they have to kill it to do so. Once House Yami has the cure, they can monopolize it and make billions.
- Fudo gets out and they have an argument aboard the ship on what to do now.
- Carter loves Fudo and wants to keep him because he thinks it'd be wrong to let it suffer from House Yami or the Cult of Tian Jiao.
- Kael views Fudo as a liability and a threat to them all. He breaks off from the crew to catch it and get rid of it behind everyone's backs.
- Asahi thinks Fudo might be a risk and doesn't want to be the one burdened with raising it. 
- Mita doesn't get involved for awhile, but then says she likes Fudo to side with Carter.
- Asahi sees how Fudo gets along with Mita and Carter and changes his mind, believing it not to be as much of a threat.
- After they catch Fudo, Wade elects to keep it because his crew wants to, but he second guesses it constantly. 


Bulk:
- They need to avoid major planets and moons, evade the several groups after them, complete bounties to stay on the move, prevent their crew from falling apart due to disagreements about the situation, and find a way to get the cure out of Fudo without killing it. Being good makes them stick out, and makes their lives a living hell.
- Locations:
	- Remote villages
	- Cities
	- Ruins
	- Ships 
	- Wilds
	- Bane Camps
	- Earth
- Threats: 
	- House Yami and the Cult of Tian Jiao were expected, but way more people are after them than they thought. 
	- House Kamui wants to kill Fudo to prevent a cure from existing because the scarcity of resources and people makes them richer. 
	- The Sultanate already dislikes them, but they're symbols of rebellion and insurrection to their control, especially now. 
	- House Ushiki wants Fudo for military applications. 
	- The Rebels want to kill Fudo to get the cure for themselves and then infect the sultanate with Bane. 
	- Every Bane Camp, or people closely associated with those infected by Bane, don't care about Fudo and are working with House Yami or the Rebels to get a cure as fast as possible. 
	- House Yori wants Mita back. 
	- House Kaga will take advantage of whoever to try and enslave them.
- Lore Progression:
	- We learn that Fudo is a beast, a type of alien/spirit thing that used to be men, but were left adrift in space, and mutated over the course of centuries by cosmic radiation.
	- We also learn that Bane was created by the Sultanate by mutating multiple diseases together to try and develop more powerful antibiotics. They did a bad job containing it, and it got out and wrought havoc. They need antibodies from something stronger in order to counteract it, but human bodies simply aren't capable of naturally fighting a disease like that off. 
	- The forces against them begin to cooperate and intensify their pursuits. 
	- They're kidnapped, separated, shot down, wounded, and broken down mentally. Wade nearly shoots Fudo after losing so much for it.
- Character Progression:
	- Over the course of the story, we also learn more about each character's backstories and why they are who they are today, and how they joined the Lightning-55.
	- Wade is put in situations in which he needs to grapple between doing the right thing and keeping the crew together.
	- Carter learns his own worth and becomes more independent. He understands that his sense of morality and role as the crew's heart is incredibly valuable. This gives him enough confidence to talk to Mita without being weird. 
	- Kael grapples with purpose and realizes that maybe a simpler life with less thrills is better for the soul than living in the moment and doing whatever he wants to. He should put more value on his relationships.
	- Mita learns to open up to the crew and stand up for herself by confronting her past. This helps her to become more comfortable with everyone, especially Carter.
	- Asahi grapples with his mortality. He realizes that avoiding everything in life is no way to live, and that he will die someday and that's ok. He starts acting a little bit more like his old self, but he's still a gentleman. 

Finales:
- The crew discovers a third party willing to develop the cure without killing Fudo. The reason no one wants to do it is because it requires incredibly expensive chemicals that can only be found on earth and are completely controlled by the Sultanate. They have to go to earth and rob the Sultan, a task that's so impossibly stupid and hard that they all almost die. 
- They then have to protect the third party while they work, and then get the cure to someone willing to distribute it cheaply and not take advantage of the situation. This proves much harder, as all of the major players arrive and attempt to steal the cure and/or Fudo. The crew comes out on top and gets the cure shipped out to 30 different planets and moons. Some of them die during this climax, but most of them survive. They go out as heroes.
- The cure makes life a million times easier for everyone in the system. Resources can be distributed more efficiently, several houses' corruption is discovered and weeded out, and the rebellion dies down under the rule of the new sultan. Things aren't perfect, but they're much, much, much better.
