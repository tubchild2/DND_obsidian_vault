You are a member of a ragtag group of scavengers very near the bottom of the criminal hierarchy. You’re after whatever treasure you can find, and you’re not in the business of saving the world, nor does the fate of the system revolve around you. You’re in for a sincere, atmosphere, light adventure with a group of loyal scumbags.

The crew is after a lost stockpile of wealth that vanished during the fall of the old world. The focus is on the **human stories**more than the lost treasure. 

Each Adventure will be a self contained adventure with a primary focus on where they go, who they meet, and what they do to get the treasure. The treasure itself isn't important or special, it's just some lost treasure.



Plague. The crew must enter and recover materials from a recently dead space station. As they board and make their way deeper, they realize that the ship was infected by Bane 2 months ago, meaning about a third of the infected are still alive and ravenous. They must survive, fend off hordes of infected, and escape.

Costs of Innovation. The crew must enter and explore an abandoned House Arai laboratory. It's a sickening, claustrophobic biopunk mess. There are several defective clones, hybrids, and cyborgs within the laboratory.

The Platinum Age of Piracy. The crew become targets of a band of pirates. They need to fend them off, negotiate, or they escape. If they're captured, the pirates sell them off to House Mori as slaves.

The Samurai of the Frontier Worlds. The crew must stop on earth and infiltrate a high society gathering. A wealthy businessman hires several Imperium samurai to protect him and something the crew needs to acquire. They need to carefully infiltrate his mansion and preferably avoid the samurai.  

Jubal Early. A bounty hunter boards the ship while the crew are sleeping. He has a complex plan which includes setting several traps to get his hands on someone aboard the ship. He doesn't have to, but he will kill them. 

The Town of Salem. The crew visits a dirt-poor town working for House Ren in waste management. Then, a group of 4 strangers pay to get transport off-world. One of them ends up dead, a bunch of stuff is missing from everyone, and someone made a distress call to the confederacy. It could be anyone, including the party members. They need to figure out who's who quickly.

Adrift. While in the dead middle of nowhere, their ship is heavily damaged and stops working. They're stranded and they can't call for help from anyone but a band of pirates, which will kill them. They're running out of oxygen. Here's the thing, the escape pods can maybe make it to the closest planet, but they can only fit 1 person each, and there's only 2. So, betrayal suddenly has immense value.

The Losing Side, Maybe, Still Not Convinced It Was The Wrong One. The crew is finally apprehended by the Confederacy. They're split up and each interrogated. They need to keep their wits about them, and find a way to escape.

Honor Among Thieves. When they finally locate the treasure, it becomes readily apparent that, if they turned on each other, they'd have a much easier time and get a much larger share of the loot. Additionally, seeds of distrust should be planted at this point.
