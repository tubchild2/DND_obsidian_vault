# Pre-Session  
### Plot/Goals  

Day 1
- Introduce everyone's characters. Then, claim that there are several major secrets being kept from one another.
- The L-55 docks in the town of Port Worst, a small independent town on Venus, to restock on fuel, and to meet up with a potential client who contacted their ship. 
- Jack Matheny is transporting some sensitive cargo. He'll pay them 50,000 credits for a short trip to his research bay on Neptune. He'll give them 10,000 now, and 40,000 on arrival. His only request is that no questions be asked, and that they avoid any confederate territory. The cargo is illegal and any contact with the confederacy would be a death sentence.
- It'll take the ship two full system-standard week to reach Neptune. It's starting to become "night," so everyone is beginning to feel tired. Separate the players whenever they go to bed, and privately ask each of them what they'd like to do now that they're by themselves. Eventually, all of them should go to their bunks and fall asleep. 

Day 2
- In the morning, after everyone has had a turn, they awake to a ransacked room. Everyone is missing several thousand credits worth of loot. Jack Matheny's 10,000 credits have been taken. Obviously, the first instinct is to assume Jack did it, but he's no where to be found. Heading to Jack's room, they find that he's been stabbed to death. 
- According to the ship, last night, someone took out the cameras and made a distress call to the confederacy. Seeing as they're in the middle of dead space with some kind of cargo the confederacy desperately wants, they're sitting ducks. The nearest landing location is 4 days away, and the confederacy will likely find them in 3. If they don't find that beacon soon, they're screwed.
- I'll then claim that none of this was planned, heavily implying this to be the work of one of the players. I will plant seeds of distrust by bringing up the fact that everyone is keeping secrets from everyone else.
- Jack's cargo has been opened. It appeared to be storing something organic in deep freeze, but it's batteries were removed.

Day 3
- During the night, plant more seeds of distrust. The more exhausted people get, the more at risk they become.
- Once again, separate the players whenever they go to bed, and privately ask each of them what they'd like to do now that they're by themselves.
- Give them encounters with the criminal. Here's the thing, don't give them enough information to confirm who it is, but give them enough information to discern it's human-esque but out of reach. 
- Get them deeply separated, and then lure them to different rooms:
	- Control Room. Someone just contacted a ship from far beyond Neptune; the LMS-66 is very far beyond any human transport. The transmission is in Morse code, and garbled behind deep breathing, a heartbeat like sound, and warbling static. When translated, the message reads as follows: "SOS to the world. 10:44pm standard time, January 17th, 2644. Signals. Signals from the deep. Estimated 60 trillion kilometers from point of contact. Infected aboard the LMS. Allen likes to play with fire. Allen likes it, Nyla. SOS. Integrity failing. How did he find the door? No man enters the gates unsafe. Infected coming closer. SOS. Red port panic, red port panic. Fifty-five. Please come in. SOS SOS SOS. Breaking orbit, drifting out now. SOS. Please come in. SOS."
	- Kitchen. Something is observing them from the doorway, but quickly moves out of sight once observed. Following the trail leads to nothing and no one.
	- Docking Bay.
	- Engine Room.
