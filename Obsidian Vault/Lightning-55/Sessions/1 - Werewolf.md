# Pre-Session 
### Plot/Goals  
Part 1: The Setup https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4YpZq4ftXpm1r2GWXiupTN?si=d3e95492bab1459c&pt=b3bc2c74f4980be0f566c6b2d7912581
- "Welcome aboard the Lightning-55. You're all part of a crew of old-world scavengers; your primary job is to loot the ruins of the frontier worlds, but you'll take just about whatever job if it means you can stay afloat. 2 days ago, you received a job from Dr. Jack Matheny, who promised an exorbitant 50 thousand credits in exchange for an incredibly basic job. He couldn't provide more details, so he requested that you meet him on [[Venus]]. You've been on your way since. At this point, after knowing each other for so long, you've become much more of a family than a crew. Really quickly, let's introduce characters."
- "Oh, and really quickly, I just want to remind everyone of the Ephesians 5:3 principle. Don't let any uncleanness even be mentioned among you. So if you're thinking of doing or saying something gross, don't."
- Introduce players. Plant seeds of doubt centered around those secrets they created. Stress that they're a family first, crew second. 
- Your ship creakily docks on the desert world of [[Venus]]. Vegetation is nowhere to be seen, thick clouds of sand and dust whip up into your eyes and mouth, and the ruins are caked in layers of dirt and cloth to block the heated sandstorms. In front of you sits the ruins of [[Ashwick]]; a once prosperous town now reduced to a handful of dried wooden structures, and a population well under 100. Dr. Matheny is reportedly waiting for you at "Dirt-Teeth Bar and Bounty." However, you're free to explore the outpost.
- Dirt-Teeth
	- Dr. Matheny introduces himself, and invites them to sit. Though the nature of the mission is largely classified, he's offering a whopping 50,000 credits for a basic 7 day trip from [[Venus]] to [[Neptune]]. He's transporting something that he can't disclose, and he requires that no questions be asked.
	- If they accept, he takes them into a private room in the back and pulls a series of rugs off a surface in the back. Hidden under them, was a large obsidian chest with 6 large purple metal locks. The crate has several vents on the sides that occasionally pulse with purple or golden light. A dense gas slowly trickles out of vents. He needs to move it into his room on the ship. The money will remain on his person until they arrive on [[Neptune]]. He'll be carrying it.

Part 2: The Ship https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6UEti90f4RT12zyDSDgl3v?si=22cc5f3344764730&pt=5841a4bc55b0432a2e50418ecd99195c
- Introduce them to the functionality of the ship. (See [[Lightning-55 (Ship) Map Information]])
- Let them explore the ship
	- Point out unimportant things that people are doing in a way the seems like they possess greater significance.
	- Imply secrets being kept between the GM and the players beyond the standard ones.
	- There's a bunch of relics of good times on the ship
		- **Pressure them to help each other out**
		- Streamers and party hats tucked away into corners.
		- A Karaoke machine that's been busted for awhile but everyone keeps in hopes of one day fixing it.
		- Photos hung on the walls of the crew on their various missions.
	- Plant ambiguous evidence / unresolved details. 
		- There's a bunch of meat in the fridge that's leaking blood.
		- There's a half burned note in the trash.
		- There are scratch or knife marks outside the vent covers.
		- There's a full katana lying across the floor of the engine room.
		- There's a trail of water droplets around the escape pod.
- Dinner Time (the crew **ALWAYS** has dinner together because they're like a family.)
	- Dr. Matheny cooks chicken for everyone. He's not good at cooking, but he tries. He's an awkward, shy scientist. He really admires Maje for his scientific mind. He fumbles with his words.
	- Dr. Matheny asks what everyone wants to buy with the 50k?
		- "What would you buy, Dr. Matheny?"
			- "Oh well, I don't think any of you would be interested in that nonsense. No disrespect to anyone in here, but the only person who'd probably understand it is Maje, who's a super chill guy might I add. I would tell you anyways but I'm not really supposed to talk about it. To put it simply, it'd be a bunch of earth technology and parts for my work."
	- Dr. Matheny is quiet, and then he asks everyone what their biggest fears are.
		- "What's your greatest fear, Dr. Matheny?"
			- "When I was a child, I used to listen to the signals from space at night up on the hill by my home. One night, I overheard something from far beyond the solar system, something impossibly old. It sounded human, like a distress call. Someone was calling to me from the deep, but there couldn't have been anyone out there. I didn't sleep that night. So, what scares me, is the idea that there's something out there I'll never understand; that there's something so horrible and so powerful that it could just toy with me like that. That thing is what scares me."
	- Dr. Matheny asks some small talk questions
		- Do you have any rivals?
			- "Do you have any rivals, Dr. Matheny?"
				- "Oh yes. As a scientist I often find that there are many people interested in stealing what I've made. Obviously I can't share the details, but [[House Arai]] has attempted to steal my work countless times. That's why I have to be careful about protecting it. I may not be a good man, but I know that giving something like that to them is wrong."
		- How long have you all been scavengers? 
		- What's the craziest job you've ever been on?


Part 3: The Inciting Incident https://open.spotify.com/playlist/62jmlPBL4uNg42FCaTCpVS?si=826c82b2bb044223&pt=57da70e976aa148a9f64ab58c9c5e0de
- I thought it might be fun if we do something a little different here. It's getting late and it's about time everyone will head to bed. Each player is going to get a chance to privately do however many things they want to before going to bed. This is the only time you'll be able to do something without your fellow players actively observing you.
	- How this is going to work is everyone message me a few things you want to do (in case of overlap), and then I'll talk to each of you privately and say what you find. I'll give each player 8 minutes. Keep your stats on you because you'll likely need to make checks even if someone else is going. If you do, keep it discreet and don't tell anyone. You can do as much as you plan for, so prepare.
- **INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT**
	- Take thorough notes during this while everyone messages you to make it seem like you're prepping what you're about to read.
	- Act surprised and say you'll have to change up some things.
- Events 
	1. Out of the corner of your eye, you barely notice a shadowy figure slip and come down a step, almost into the kitchen.
		- As you turn to face them, you see them slide out of sight, and you hear the sound of fast, almost wet sounding footsteps.
		- Let them do the other thing last.
	2. Out of the corner of your eye, and just within your range of hearing, you notice a faint beeping red light coming from the cockpit radio.
		- Out of the corner of your eye, a faint red light blinks on the cockpit radio — a soft beeping, almost lost beneath the hum of the ship.
		- You remember the warnings from training: never touch the radio, never question its silence. Its importance was not to be tested. But the message log tells a different story. Someone — _someone on this ship_ — sent an outgoing distress call, a short burst of text, directly to the Confederacy. They told them who you are, where you are, and about the illegal cargo aboard.
		- Your stomach drops as you scroll through the logs. The blinking red light isn’t just a warning; it’s a response. The Confederacy accepted the message.
		- They’ll be here in one hour. And when they arrive, they won’t come to negotiate. They’ll enslave, torture, interrogate, sell, or kill you all — like they’ve done to countless others. You can almost hear the echoes of the friends you’ve lost to them, the ships they’ve reduced to ash, the stories of people who thought they could escape.
		- They don’t care about criminals. They care about control. They’re fast. Unpredictable. Absolute. A single one of their ships could destroy twenty like yours without breaking formation. The Lightning-55 doesn’t even have guns.
		- No one survives the Confederacy. No one. And now they’re coming.
		- You have one hour. What do you do?
		- Let them do the other thing last.
	3. As you're walking, you hear something coming from the bedrooms that instantly catches you off guard. It's the sound of muffled screaming, of desperate choking and gargling to try and get free. The clatter of objects falling as someone attempts to crawl to safety and cry for help. What do you do?
		- Let them do the other thing first
		- As you approach, you see that the door of Dr. Matheny has been left half-opened, and that a loose trail of blood runs off away from the room.
		- Entering the room, you see Dr. Matheny's bloodied corpse sprawled out on the floor. His face is swollen and bloodied, his neck is bruised from strangulation, and his chest lies cut open and pooling fresh blood. This wasn't just a murder, this was the specific descriptive act of someone sick. His blank swollen eyes stare up towards the ceiling. 
		- Looking around the room, you notice his cargo has been opened and emptied, and all 50,000 of his credits stolen. Somebody was desperate enough for money to kill an innocent man.
	4. You see the ship's security cameras roving back and forth as you walk down the halls, when suddenly, they all simultaneously stop in place, seemingly fixated on something behind you. Someone just took control of the cameras. As you watch, the camera suddenly falls. Someone deactivated it. They may have deactivated all of them.
		- Let them do the other thing last.
	5. As you pass by the engine room, you hear it's reassuring sputtering and clanking. Then, suddenly, it stops. Someone just turned the engine off mid-flight.
		- Let them do the other thing first. You can continue on if you'd like.
		- As you enter into the engine room, you notice the a vent cover has been pulled off the wall. The engine is completely deactivated, and its brass panel has been ripped open.
			- The captain's lock feature has been enabled, meaning that somebody locked the engine and changed the password. There's now way around it without damaging the ship, meaning that unless you find out who did this, the ship isn't going to be moving any time soon. You're adrift in space now.
- Gather everyone back together and ask if they'd like to go to bed, or meet back together and discuss.

Part 4: The Witch Hunt (cut the music or continue the dread music, whichever seems better)
- Don't reveal this, but this is the situation (despite the fuzzy timeline):
	- Someone aboard the ship disabled the engine and changed the password, locking your ship in space.
	- This individual then entered Dr. Matheny's room, killed him, stole the 50,000 credits, and emptied his cargo.
	- Then, wanting to cover their tracks, they took out the ship's cameras, and erased the footage.
	- Finally, they contacted [[the Confederacy]]. They told them about something illegal, and now they're on their way.
	- [[The confederacy]] is going to board your ship in one hour, and you'll be severely outmatched.
- From my perspective, as the GM, you have a few options:
	- You can figure out who did it and either execute them with the airlock, leave them behind with the escape, or try to get the engine password out of them to get the ship moving.
	- You can hunker down and attempt to fight off [[the confederacy]] as a team with a severe disadvantage.
	- Or you can turn on each other and take the pod for yourselves, dooming everyone else on board.
- Start the 1 hour real-time timer.
- Don't reveal any more info because that's meta gaming.
- The session ends when the timer runs out because "I didn't plan for this."

Part 5: Endings https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5roXHx1Q5C97mEGZATwv6T?si=9b664e61db99439a&pt=07c529e99a0112eb899a288e83d7ea0a
- Execution. The airlock hisses open, and for a moment, you swear you see doubt in their eyes. Maybe they deserved it. Maybe they didn’t. Their body drifts into the void, growing smaller until they vanish into the endless dark. Before they leave your vision, you see the life slowly fade from their eyes. The ship is quieter now. You all board the escape pods, and you don't say a word. That's where we'll leave it.
- Conflict. The sound of shouts, blades, and gunfire plays over and over in your head. Your family has just torn itself apart, and now it's quiet. The survivors stumble into the escape pods, blood on their hands, hearts heavy, and you say nothing. You may have kept your life, but you also may have lost something greater than that. That's where we'll leave it.
- Nobility. One of you stayed behind. Not because anyone one forced them — but because it was their choice. A final smile, a last word, a hand pressed to the glass as the rest of you seal the pod. As the pod launches, you see them grow smaller, standing proud and unshaken in the flickering lights of the ship. It’s a sacrifice you’ll carry forever. You survive — because they chose hope, because they chose _you._ You don't know who did it, or even if it was one of you. Despite that, you still chose without reservation to lay down your life to save the others, and that's what it means to be a family. That's where we'll leave it.
- Abandoned. The decision is made too quickly. Maybe it was fear. Maybe it was cruelty. One is left behind, pounding on the glass, begging for a chance they never got. The pod ignites, and you drift away, leaving their voice to fade into silence. Survival is yours — but when you close your eyes, all you’ll see is the moment you abandoned your own. Was it worth it? Was leaving them to face unbeatable odds to save yourself the best decision? You'll never know. That's where we'll leave it.
- Together. The alarms blare. The Confederacy is coming. And yet… none of you move for the pods. Not one. You stand shoulder to shoulder, weapons in hand, hearts steady. You know the odds. You know what’s coming. But you also know this: no one here is a traitor. No one here is your enemy. As the ship shudders and the enemy closes in, you feel something rare, something unbreakable. Even if you die tonight, you’ll die together — a family, to the very end. You feel a sharp sense of pride come up into your hearts. That's where we'll leave it.
