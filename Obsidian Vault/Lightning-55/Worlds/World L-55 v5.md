### Introduction
- 204 years ago, the confederacy of earth, a conglomerate government made up of 8 Great Houses, grew beyond earth and colonized the solar system.
- 4 years ago, Bane wiped out 88% of the population, leaving the confederate colonies on the frontier worlds to fend for themselves.
- With trade crippled, modern technology became a commodity. Technologically, those remaining were forced to largely revert to feudal Japan.
- Working the land wasn't an option for most, and serving the Confederacy meant chains, whether literal or not. 
- So, those left began the second age of piracy--an age of collective desperation to loot the fallen worlds before the Confederacy, or take what you can get from others.
 - Everyone is desperate and will lie, cheat, and steal. However, no one takes it personally, and it's never surprising.

### Timeline
2440
- The biggest government is the Confederacy of Nations.
	- It's a combination of the Pacific Alliance of Corporations (Japan / China) and the Western Alliance of Corporations (America / Europe).
	- Spoken word is primarily English with some Japanese.
	- Written word is a combination of Chinese and Japanese.
	- Christianity, Atheism, and Buddhism are the three most common religions.
- The Confederacy is split into 8 Great Houses, each with a powerful monopoly. A Great House is like if Disney was a family business. They're competitive for power but rely on each other. This means that, due to holding each other accountable and each having insane power, each House is incredible on the surface, but horrific if you go into how they operate.
	- House Yori, the House of Order. Like the Samurai, a private form of hired law enforcement. They control the military, mercenaries, law, and contracts. The President oversees the 8 houses from here, he's mostly just a face.
	- House Sui, the House of Culture. They control food, drink, media, entertainment, fashion, and religion. They're the masters of propaganda. 
	- House Kuroda, the House of Information. They control spies, exploration, navigation, education, and manipulation. 
	- House Arai, the House of Innovation. They innovate with cloning, infusions, hybrids, implants, ships, weapons, terraforming, and medicine. They don't mass produce, they're hired to invent. They will perform horrific experiments in the name of science.
	- House Kaga, the House of Production. The counterpart to House Arai, they build things. They control construction, architecture, terraforming, and manufacturing. If it exists, they're the ones who'll produce it.
	- House Mori, the House of Labor. They control the job market and slavery. They don't shy away from exploiting debts, kidnapping, or manipulation. Whatever makes people work harder, they'll do it.
	- House Ren, the House of Resources. They produce clean water, internet, energy, fuel, mining, wood, recycling, and they handle all waste.
	- House Inaba, the House of Currency. They produce and control currency. They run the entire banking system.
- The Confederacy colonized and began to loosely control the 28+ planets and moons of our solar system.
- House Arai new products now produced by House Kaga.
	- Clones. Bred for slavery, combat, or prostitution. Bred to lack autonomy, but aren't completely obedient.
	- Infusions. DNA altering injections to improve performance in strength, speed, intelligence, or more.
	- Implants. Devices surgically implanted to improve performance in strength, speed, intelligence, or more. 
	- Hybrids. Combination species that act as pets, guards, and monsters.

2640-2643
- Bane, begins silently infecting people across the system. No one knows where it started, or what it came from.
	- Bane causes rapid, uncontrolled cell division within the body to maximize its numbers.
	- The body cannot functionally fight it once infected.
	- After an hour, even a single drop of your blood can infect 30 people.
	- Muscle and bone deformities, tumors, cysts, blood clots, and mutations erupt in 6 hours.
	- The pain, paranoia, and hunger causes madness and aggression in 12 hours.
	- Eventually, you bleed out and die. This typically takes 3 months.
	- The infected can pilot ships, communicate, and use weapons, but they're ravenous, insane, pleasure driven cannibals
- On November 11th, people begin to show symptoms system-wise. Chi No Hi (Blood Day) / The Day of Blood. 88% of humanity died within the next 3 months. The lack of trade, infrastructure, and resources led to mass starvation and improvised governments. Almost all consistent contact across planets and space stations was lost overnight. All of frontier society collapsed in weeks, leaving majority of the solar system riddled with dead civilizations and space stations.
- Technologically speaking, majority of the system reverted to feudal Japan as that was all they could afford.
	- Guns, bombs, ships, and anything that runs on electricity is incredibly expensive and rare.
- Thousands of the Confederacy's now independent space-faring military camps unionized and formed the Imperium.
	- Like the Samurai, the Imperium could be hired to enforce and kill.
	- They are predominately Christian. 
	- In a world as desperate as this one, the Imperium quickly gained more power than the Confederacy.
- The Confederacy is attempting to regain control by fostering dependence on their resources, jobs, and protection.
	- To help with this, and out of greed, the Great Houses jacked up their prices.
	- The Confederacy is a cruel organization, but they have weapons, ships, infusions, hybrids, clones, and implants.
	- Some independents resisted. There's no rebellion, as there's not much to rebel anymore. The world is quiet.
- Earth is recovering nicely, but on those frontier planets, survival is the top priority. There are three options:
	- Farming and fishing is the best option, but most can't due to population density or terraforming problems.
	- If you can, join the Confederacy or Imperium. You will hate it, and they will hate you.
	- Far and away the most common practice is salvage and piracy.
- The culture has changed, giving rise to a generally followed pirate code:
	- Desperate times call for desperate measures. 
	- There's honor among thieves.
	- Take care of your own.
	- Never leave a man behind.
	- Make the best with what you have.
	- Everyone has the right to parley.
	- When you can't run, you crawl. When you can't crawl, you find someone to carry you.
	- Everyone is desperate, and will turn on you, but they'll still warmly welcome you in and make the best of a bad situation with you.
