Introduction

In the wake of a plague that wiped out 88% of humanity, survival becomes the top priority. You either work with the corrupt Confederacy and their monopolistic Houses, the Imperium warlords and their genocidal samurai, or you scour the dead worlds of the solar system for resources as a pirate and salvager. You make the best with what little you have, as the majority of the system has reverted to feudal Japan. Basically, it’s a space pirate samurai adventure in a dead solar system.

2640

- Bane, a pandemic started on Europa, begins silently infecting people across the system.
    

- Bane causes rapid, uncontrolled cell division within the body to maximize its numbers.
    
- The body cannot functionally fight it once infected.
    
- After an hour, even a single drop of your blood can infect 30 people.
    
- Muscle and bone deformities, tumors, cysts, blood clots, and mutations erupt in 6 hours.
    
- The pain, paranoia, and hunger causes madness and aggression in 12 hours.
    
- Eventually, you bleed out and die. This typically takes 3 months.
    

- On November 11th, people begin to show symptoms system-wise. Chi No Hi / Day of Blood. 
    
- The lack of trade, infrastructure, and resources led to mass starvation and improvised governments.
    
- Almost all consistent contact across planets and space stations was lost overnight.
    
- 88% of humanity died.
    

  

2643

- Technologically speaking, majority of the system reverted to feudal Japan as that was all they could afford.
    

- Guns, bombs, ships, and anything that runs on electricity is incredibly expensive and rare.
    

- Thousands of the Confederacy's now independent space-faring military camps unionized and formed the Imperium. 
    

- Like the Samurai, the Imperium could be hired to enforce and kill.
    
- They have heavy Christian ties, and are incredibly racist to Buddhists.
    
- In a world as desperate as this one, the Imperium quickly gained more power than the Concord.
    

- The Confederacy is attempting to regain control by fostering dependence on their resources, jobs, and protection.
    

- To help with this, and out of greed, the Great Houses jacked up their prices.
    
- The Confederacy is a cruel organization, but they have weapons, ships, infusions, hybrids, clones, and implants.
    
- Some independents resisted. There's no rebellion, as there's not much to rebel anymore. The world is quiet.
    

- Earth is recovering nicely, but on those outer worlds, survival is the top priority. There are three options:
    

- Farming and fishing is the best option, but most can't due to population density or terraforming problems.
    
- If you can, join the Confederacy or Imperium. You will hate it, and they will hate you.
    
- Far and away the most common practice is salvage and piracy.
    

- The culture has changed, giving rise to a generally followed pirate code:
    

- Desperate times call for desperate measures. 
    
- There is honor among thieves.
    
- Take care of your own.
    
- Never leave a man behind.
    
- Make the best with what you have.
    
- Everyone has the right to parley.
