- I did add one cool thing; ships of this class and above have a Survivor's Lock; by entering a password you can shut the engine down. This is commonly used as a negotiation tactic. The password is disabled and it can probably be changed if any of you want, so it's not all that important, but it's a fun little worldbuilding quirk of the ship. Don't mess with this.

Escape Pod
- There are two, and they can each fit 2 people, meaning that one of you will have to stay behind.
- Once again, don't mess with these.
