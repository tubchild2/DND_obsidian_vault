## Description
A small town established in the dunes of [[Venus]]. It was formerly a mining settlement, dispatched to harvest the rich resources of [[Venus]]'s core. The town's construction was never interrupted by [[Bane]]. It's barely self sufficient, and has become a fairly undergrounds meeting location for scavengers and criminals. Water is drawn up from a well built over a water deposit beneath the sand. Power is poorly generated by solar devices and old rechargeable batteries, thought not much in Ashwick runs on electricity. Food needs to be shipped in, or hunted for. Most people in Ashwick are visitors; they come here to pick up bounties, meet up with people, or rest. 

## Docks
Built atop a series of large concrete tiles, each one capable of supporting ships several times larger than yours. There's a fueling station nearby to allow you to purchase fuel. 
## Dirt-Teeth Bar and Bounty
A crowded and dirty bar run by Dirt-Teeth. He got the nickname due to his rotten teeth. It's a seedy saloon with a bounty board in the corner that's packed with bounties. There's a room in the back for private meetings. There are apples for sale.
## Ashwick Inn
Constructed from the ruins of 13 different apartment buildings, its layout is impossibly confusing. It's a complex network of cramped hallways, stairwells, and ladders. It feels like navigating an ant farm. It's run by Johnny, a fairly elderly individual.
## Ashwick Arms
The store has multiple gaps in its walls poorly patched by transparent rags. Wooden beams keep the ceiling together. All kinds of melee weapons, common ranged weapons, and common armors. He's got a few select items that are worth more due to their rarity. Run by an intimidating gentlemen with an eye patch (a canyon sprite took his eye out) named Bill. He's an experienced monster hunter. 
## Greater Canyon General Store
A moderately stocked store featuring most common items. Run by a friendly dude named Waylen.
## Sewage Entrance
In the far northeast of the town, you can find a ruined portion of the town. It once featured Ashwick's primary source of wealth: the Lead and Bismuth mines. Unfortunately, they've since been picked clean and reduced to rubble. You can find an entrance into Ashwick's outmoded sewage system, which hasn't been cleaned or maintained in 4 years. If you're bold enough to venture into the sewers or the mines, be prepared for more feces then you've ever seen in your whole life.
## Water Treatment Plant and Solar Field
On the far east end of the town is the town's water supply; it's a tiny oasis that has been thoroughly dirtied and drained over the past few years. The filters still function at the treatment plant, but there aren't enough people to run it, so it's a strange, improvised system of ropes and pulleys to fetch water from the oasis. The solar field is dirtied and barely functional, but it provides just enough power to keep the town going.
