The confederacy is a conglomerate super government that formed from of the Pacific Alliance of Corporations (Japan / China) and the Western Alliance of Corporations (America / Europe) in 2303.
- Spoken word within the Confederacy is primarily English with some Japanese.
- Written word within the Confederacy is a combination of Chinese and Japanese.
- Christianity, Atheism, and Buddhism are the three most common religions within the Confederacy.

The Confederacy is split into 8 Great Houses, each with a powerful monopoly. A Great House is like if Disney was a family business. They're competitive for power but rely on each other. This means that, due to holding each other accountable and each having insane power, each House seems incredible on the surface, but is increasingly horrific the deeper you go.
