House Arai is the House of innovation. They innovate with cloning, infusions, hybrids, implants, ships, weapons, terraforming, and medicine. They don't mass produce; they're hired to test by whatever means necessary. They regularly work with [[House Kaga]] for production.

They created thousands of unique species and seeded them the frontier worlds to repopulate and adapt.
