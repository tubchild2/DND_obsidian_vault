### Introduction
- 204 years ago, [[the confederacy]] of [[earth]], a conglomerate government made up of 8 Great Houses, grew beyond [[earth]] and colonized the solar system.
- 4 years ago, a pandemic called Bane wiped out 88% of the population, leaving the confederate colonies on the frontier worlds to fend for themselves.
- With trade crippled, modern technology became a commodity. Technologically, those remaining were forced to largely revert to feudal Japan.
- Working the land wasn't an option for most, and serving [[the Confederacy]] meant chains, whether literal or not. 
- So, those left began the second age of piracy--an age of collective desperation to loot the fallen worlds before [[the Confederacy]], or take what you can get from others.
 - Everyone is desperate and will lie, cheat, and steal. However, no one takes it personally, and it's never surprising.

### Timeline
2303
- [[The Confederacy]] formed from the Pacific Alliance of Corporations and the Western Alliance of Corporations. 

2440
- [[The Confederacy]] colonized and began to loosely control the 28+ planets and moons of our solar system.
- [[House Arai]] invented new products that are now produced by [[House Kaga]].
	- Clones. Bred for slavery, combat, or darker things. Bred to lack autonomy, but aren't completely obedient.
	- Infusions. DNA altering injections to improve performance in strength, speed, intelligence, or more.
	- Implants. Devices surgically implanted to improve performance in strength, speed, intelligence, or more. 
	- Hybrids. Combination species that act as pets, guards, monsters, and (rarely) just regular people. These were developed primarily to seed the frontier worlds with new life. Mostly unintelligent. 

2640-2643
- Bane begins silently infecting people across the system. No one knows where it came from.
- On November 11th (The Day of Blood / Chi No Hi), people begin to show symptoms system-wide. 88% of humanity died within the next 3 months. The lack of trade, infrastructure, and resources led to mass starvation and improvised governments. Almost all consistent contact across planets and space stations was lost overnight. All of frontier society collapsed in weeks, leaving majority of the solar system riddled with dead civilizations and space stations.
- Technologically speaking, majority of the system reverted to feudal Japan as that was all they could afford.
	- Guns, bombs, ships, and anything that runs on electricity is incredibly expensive and rare beyond [[earth]].
- Thousands of [[the Confederacy]]'s now independent space-faring military camps unionized and formed the Imperium.
- [[The Confederacy]] is attempting to regain control by fostering dependence on their resources, jobs, and protection.
	- To help with this, and out of greed, the Great Houses jacked up their prices.
	- [[The Confederacy]] is a cruel organization, but they have weapons, ships, infusions, hybrids, clones, and implants.
	- Some independents resisted. There's no rebellion, as there's not much to rebel anymore. The world is quiet.
- [[Earth]] is recovering nicely, but on those frontier planets, survival is the top priority. There are three options:
	- Farming and fishing is the best option, but most can't for any number of reasons.
	- If you can, joining [[the Confederacy]] or Imperium is a decent option. They are terrible, though.
	- Far and away the most common practice is salvage and piracy of the ruins of the frontier worlds.
- The culture has changed in the wake of piracy's rise:
	- Desperate times call for desperate measures. 
	- There's honor among thieves.
	- Take care of your own.
	- Never leave a man behind.
	- Make the best with what you have.
	- Everyone has the right to parley.
	- When you can't run, you crawl. When you can't crawl, you find someone to carry you.
	- Everyone is desperate, and will turn on you, but they'll still warmly welcome you in and make the best of a bad situation with you.
