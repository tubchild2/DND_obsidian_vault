## CREW
**Wade Kyou** 
	Nathan Drake + Malcolm Reynolds.
	Charismatic well-rounded dummy that loves adventuring. Incredibly impulsive. Con artist. Quick witted. Steals, lies, tricks, and hits. The leader.
	Has a lot of people that hate him. 
**Carter Hayes** 
	Superman + Charlie Kelly. 
	Unbelievably stupid but empathetic. He can't read, write, or do preschool math. Optimistic and handy in combat, but only attacks if people try to kill him first. The right-hand man. Not very attractive. Born into a poor farming family. Appreciates everything.
	Deeply insecure about himself. Feels inferior to everyone around him, and is willing to give his life for anyone else.
	The world's unluckiest man that still chooses to be good. He can't control what happens to him, but he can control himself, and he can find joy in whatever he wants.
**Mita Yori**
	Vin + Dennis Reynolds. Technician, Pilot, surgeon, book smart, quiet. She's a shy, reserved, sadistic character. She doesn't speak, and when she does it's in quiet whispers. She's incredibly serious and does her own thing aboard the ship. She's only really comfortable around Wade and Carter, and even then she needs to be like blackout drunk to be normal. She knows a bunch of weird party tricks that she picked up over the years. Her seriousness and secret psychopathy and criminal acts are played off as jokes no one wants to know the details of. She doesn't usually go with Carter and Wade on missions because she takes care of the ship and doesn't like direct combat. She defends the ship through expert use of stealth takedowns. 

## DYNAMIC
**Carter + Wade**
	Carter's stupidity plays off Wade's recklessness and they often get into bad situations because of it. Carter disagrees with his violent tendencies and believes in doing the right thing in all situations. Wade has to tell Carter to break his code sometimes, which Carter doesn't like. Carter will make decisions for the greater good that endanger the mission, which Wade dislikes.
**Carter + Mita**
	Mita respects Carter quite a bit, but Carter is far too stupid and outgoing to operate on her level. Carter thinks Mita is a genius and wants to befriend her, but doesn't like some of the questionable things she does in secret. She has boxes of organs hidden in strange places and isn't honest about everything she does.
**Wade + Mita**
	They both think they're better than the other, but they have a mutual sense of respect. They argue like siblings. Carter thinks Mita is brilliant but too careful and quiet. Mita thinks Carter is a good, brave man, but a stupid one. They trust each other in a pinch.

## REPUTATION
- Honorable enough for following the pirate code:
	- Everyone has the right to parley. 
	- Leave no man behind.
	- Ship secrets live as long as the crew is united.
- Even more honorable for following a personal ship code on top of the pirate code
	- Don't kill people that don't try to kill you first.
	- Leave 10% of whatever you find behind.
	- Give people an honorable death to the best of your ability.
	- Let prisoners go free unless they attempt revenge.
- Liked by common folk, despite being some of the weakest pirates out there.
- Greatly underestimated due to their few numbers and weak ship and bad reputation.
- They're gnats to the Imperium. Not something worth pursuing unless it's easy. They'll chase them and try to arrest them, but once they get away, they don't care enough to keep going.
