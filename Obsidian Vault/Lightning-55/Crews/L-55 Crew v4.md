### Reputation
- Honorable enough for following the pirate code, and even more honorable for following a personal ship code on top of the pirate code:
	- Don't kill people that don't try to kill you first.
	- Leave 10% of whatever you find behind.
	- Give people an honorable death to the best of your ability.
	- Let prisoners go free unless they attempt revenge.
- Liked by common folk, despite being some of the most chaotic salvagers out there.
- Greatly underestimated due to their few numbers and weak ship and bad reputation.
- They're gnats to the Imperium and to the Confederacy. Not something worth pursuing unless it's easy. They'll chase them and try to arrest them, but once they get away, they don't care enough to keep going.
