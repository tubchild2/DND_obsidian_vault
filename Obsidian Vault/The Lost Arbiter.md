The Last Arbiter
**Campaign #1: Uncharted Galaxy**
Long ago, Dale Borland was a NPC weapons shopkeeper. He lived a happy life until he met the PCs. They targeted him, killed mutilated his family (including his newborn daughter, 7yr old son, and pregnant wife), took his arm, left him permanently scarred and with severe vocal trauma, and then left him to bleed out. 

It was at that point that he learned of a resource far beyond any science or magic in tabletop; sheer willpower. His hatred for the PCs, and his desire for revenge were so strong, that he barely survived. He constructed a cybernetic arm, a series of powerful weapons, and a new faceplate, and began hunting the party. Ultimately, he failed, and was left to die as the PCs ended his universe. His final moments were spent stabbing one of the already dying PCs. 

As the world ended, and he stared up at his planet's crumbling red sky, he vanished. He entered a blue and red void, and was greeted by an entity known as "the Dreamer." According to the entity, it was what perpetuated the world, but it was now waking due to the PCs actions. The world was never real, it was just a tabletop game played by a bunch of friends; everything was going to vanish in a few moments. However, if he truly wanted revenge, the dreamer had one more option left.

The dreamer wasn't magical, nor was he scientific, he operated on the laws of narrative power; the creator of the world wrote him to be capable of actions without reason or justification. That power surpassed everything else, and would forever be tied to the writer. If the dreamer passed that power into Dale, he could survive the end of the campaign. In fact, he could survive anything. Dale asked if the dreamer was sure he'd survive; the dreamer wasn't sure, but he knew there weren't any better options for him. Besides, it was the only way they could get revenge for the way they mistreated their world. The Dreamer's shifting void of a body extended an incorporeal hand to Dale, who, after a moment of thought, accepted it and shook his hand. The power of the Dreamer passed into Dale, and the world went dark.


**Campaign #2: Vaerith**
Dale woke up. He had been sealed in a strange amalgam of different worldbuilding elements that had formed a type of egg in an inaccessible corner of the map. He had been floating for some time, but and he slowly descended down to touch the floor. He wasn't sure how to escape from this strange prison, but he knew he had the power to. 

With a single swift bunch, he tore through the egg and walked outside into what appeared to be a long since abandoned Tibetan temple. It was freezing as his nude, stunned body walked through the snow. He was still missing an arm, and his throat was still scarred and mangled. He imagined having his arm back, and a series of black wisps began to form around the stump of his right arm. He was startled at first, but then he tried again. With focus, he was able to slowly form a brass arm. These black wisps possessed far greater power than he could've ever dreamed of.

Over the next 2 weeks, he practiced, and he discovered what he was truly capable of:
1. Immortality. Nothing, not even the ending of the campaign, could kill him. He'd just regenerate or respawn in an egg buried on the map.
2. He was deeply connected to the PCs and to the worldbuilding. He could learn everything the author wrote. The author wasn't necessarily aware of his presence, though. Whenever they did anything vile, he'd know.
3. Narrative Influence. Anything he could imagine, he could form or destroy. That meant people, places, weapons, explosions, and more. He could never bring his family back as they were, though, because he wasn't the author.
4. Space, Time, and World Manipulation. He can teleport to any location, at any point in time, in any universe or campaign, instantaneously.
5. Physical Power. He was unbelievably strong, fast, and intelligent. 

That's when he made a vow. Whenever he's alerted to the PCs actions, and they do something inhumane, he will hunt them down. They have no chance at killing him, but they may evade him for a short amount of time. Unless they tip the scales back to balance and undo whatever they did, he's going to hunt them indefinitely.


The True Arbiter; The Lost Judge; The Game Master's Angel
Dale Borland's entire family was brutally mutilated by the PCs as a joke. This was a sin so pure, so unbelievable, that he managed to survive the assault and go after them. Despite being as powerful as he was, they escaped and eventually killed him through sheer luck. They then went on to literally destroy the universe and everything in it.

As one final act, the "Dreamer," a cosmic entity perpetuating the dying universe, formulated a plan. The Dreamer was essentially the GM's angel; a being gifted with narrative influence, allowing them to alter reality as they see fit. The Dreamer was going to be eliminated when the campaign ended by the GM's choice, but if they combined into a single entity, they could survive and continue to act under the GM. Dale agreed and blacked out. When he woke up, he was in the void; the realm of the GM. Together, they agreed that his new role would be as the Last Arbiter, as the GM's personal judge. 

Whenever the PCs acted in a way so unbelievably disgusting that it warranted intervention, the Last Arbiter would be placed into the universe. His only duty is to find and eliminate the criminals to tip the cosmic scales of good and evil to balance. They have no chance of killing him, and he will eventually find them. However, if they tip the cosmic scales themselves, and find a way to undo their crimes in a way the GM approves, The Last Arbiter will return to the void.

PCs will be alerted by the GM whenever he enters the world, and there will be inexplicable wisps of darkness, and deafening whispers in their heads. Minor missteps won't cause anything except maybe a brief sighting, but major transgressions that would get someone in major trouble in real life cause him to be released. He acts as an unstoppable force of nature, a being of pure dread, a way to terrify the players.

MECHANICS
- Whenever a PC commits to an unforgivable, disgusting, completely over the line action, the Arbiter is released. He will remain active until he kills that PC or the scales are tipped back into balance by the PC undoing the action in a way the GM approves of.
- He won't immediately kill the players, because that will be lame. Instead, he'll toy with them, scare them, and push them to try to undo the action in the best way possible. If they refuse, then he'll kill them.
- He will appear 5 minutes after the players commit the action. There will be several signs he's approaching, and the players will be aware of it.

- He can explode through time and space, but he moves at the speed of a regular human.
- He has access to every weapon and ability in the active campaign at their maximum level.
- His defense / AC is 30, he has +20 to hit, and he has 1000 hit points.
- He can bore / explode through any wall or surface to continue his hunt.
