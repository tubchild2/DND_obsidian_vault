### Session 3 Stuff
- Fix [[Pluto]]'s Letter. 
	- Longer. More poetic. 
- Make physical copy of [[Pluto]]'s Letter.
	- Print it
	- Rip it
	- Stain it
	- Texture it

### Worldbuilding (Uncharted Galaxy)
- As a resource, the ability to produce [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] can be exchanged. Power can be given, and [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] can increase in power. 
- [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] is manipulating people throughout [[The Galaxy]].
	- Has his hooks into [[Bradford]], and by proxy [[House Galling]], and by proxy the [[Federation]]. Via [[Bradford]] he has a direct say in [[Federation]] matters. Earned [[Bradford]]'s trust by exploiting his faith and fear.
	- The Rest of the Empires
- [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] hated the [[The Multiverse|cataclysm]] despite being a [[Primordials and Feeders|primordial]]. He seeks to control our world, not bring it into chaos. 
- [[The Uncatchable Man|The Man in the Fog]] is a [[Hyperbeings|hyperbeing]], and he despises the [[The Multiverse|cataclysm]]. [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] will likely cause the [[The Multiverse|cataclysm]] while trying to avoid it, so he wants to do everything he can to help [[the party]] destroy what he needs. 
- [[The uncatchable man]] is the [[Tessali]] post-recovery. They want to help [[the party]] but can't really risk getting involved because they're the key to what [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] needs. 


### Next Campaign
- Cycle 3. 
- Smaller detailed world.
- Reoccurring characters.
- Fantastical world that takes full advantage of the PHB, DMG, and MM. 
- [[Ether and Unether|Ethology]] is common, but not everyone uses it. 
- Sandbox approach, in which players make their own goals based off their characters.
