### Worldbuilding

- [[Eathyst and E-Tech|E-Tech]] components. They let you program new spells functionally
	- Voltage. The range of the effect. The [[Ether]] pressure.
	- Amperage. The amount of [[Ether]]. The power source.
	- Charge. The idea the [[Ether]] conducts. The effect. Also changes to the effect. 
### Finale

### Campaign 2
- Tone and General Vibes
- Character creation guide for campaign 2
	- Include multiclassing

### The Next Campaign Concept
- More in depth character creation process. I want to take inspiration from what Avery did.
- A different cycle
- Smaller detailed world.
- Reoccurring characters.
- [[Ether|Ethology]] is common, but not everyone uses it. 
- Sandbox approach, in which players make their own goals based off their characters.
