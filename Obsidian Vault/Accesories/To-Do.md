### Pre Session 3
- Print [[CSG and HG Soldiers|inquisitors]] x6
- Print [[CSG and HG Soldiers|enforcers]] x3

### TO PACK
- MINIS
- [[Pluto]]'s Second note
- Big Minis (in case of [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnaves]])

### Worldbuilding (Uncharted Galaxy)
- As a resource, the ability to produce [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] can be exchanged. Power can be given, and [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] can increase in power. 
- There are creatures that are part of [[The True Nature of Existence|the Sleeper]]. They act as caretakers, overseers, and keep things operational. If [[Primordials and Feeders|primordials]] are something like Greek or Roman gods, these things are like angels. They outclass the [[Primordials and Feeders|primordials]] like it's not even funny. [[The True Nature of Existence|The Sleeper]] is like the Christian God power-level wise. Though canonically, he's not even close to God power-wise because he's just a person who's asleep. 

### The Next Campaign
- A different cycle
- Smaller detailed world.
- Reoccurring characters.
- Fantastical world that takes full advantage of the PHB, DMG, and MM. 
- [[Ether and Unether|Ethology]] is common, but not everyone uses it. 
- Sandbox approach, in which players make their own goals based off their characters.
