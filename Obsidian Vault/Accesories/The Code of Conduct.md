### Rules
**Rule 1: Ephesians 5:3**
- Whether in or out of game, try to steer clear from perverse, violent, racist, or otherwise offensive material.
- Obviously jokes are fine, but there's a very large line between a joke, and something that'd get you slapped in public. 
- As a rule of thumb--if what you're saying or doing would get you talked to by the elders, it's probably not a great move to say it at the table!

**Rule 2: Using My Setting**
- Campaigns and one-shots set in any of my worlds are allowed, but they have to remain completely separate from all other campaigns unless their DMs agree to it.
- You can add whatever you'd like to my world. Just keep it separate, and of a scale that the other DMs wouldn't have to also incorporate your ideas into their campaigns. You don't want to roadblock other DMs with what's happening in your campaign unless they agree to it. 

**Rule 3: Hosting**
- No one can host more than 2 games in a row. 
- Be a sigma and host.

**Rule 4: PVP**
- PVP is only allowed if both parties agree to it. If one person tries to attack another, the other gets to decide whether the attack hits or not. 

**Rule 5: Character Sheets**
- I'm genuinely running out of space in my backpack and drawers. Since I don't need them on a day-to-day basis, it's making things more difficult, and you're the only ones who interact with them, please keep track of them yourselves. 
- Please be responsible with them!

**Rule 6: Character Making**
- All classes and races are playable, but expect tweaks to avoid spiritism.
- Multiclassing is allowed, but only do it if your character has a good reason for it, or if you're experienced enough to do it well.
- Your characters will start at level 1 unless your backstory warrants levels 2 or 3
- We use the standard array for ability scores. 

### Punishments:
I'm not firm enough with my punishments, so your punishments will be collectively decided by the entire group. Whatever they decide will go into instant effect. If you keep violating the rules, though, you'll be asked to leave. 

### Expectations
**The Rule of Cool**
- If something is cool, but not technically allowed by the rules, I'll fudge the numbers to make it possible. 
- Example: using sleep on a cup of water to make a sleep potion. That's not how sleep works but it's cool, balanced, and it encourages roleplay.

**Character Based Storytelling**
- Please try to make and play a well-made character. 
- This takes a lot of the pressure off me, and is more fun generally.
