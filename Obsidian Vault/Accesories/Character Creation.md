### Step 1: Get to Know the Game and the Campaign
**The Game**
If you've never done so, I'd recommend reading the first chapter of the player's handbook (PHB). You don't need to know the game inside and out to play (that's what the DM and Google are for), but a general understanding of the flow of the game would be great. If not for yourself, do it for the sake of the other players!

**The Campaign**
If you haven't already, learn what the rules, expectations, and world of the campaign will be. 

### Step 2: Character Ideation
This step lays the foundation for your character. What will they do in interactions, combat, and exploration (ICE)?
- Species
- Class or Classes (if multiclassing)
- Background
- Character Gimmick (lazy, brave, honorable, stupid, lying, etc.)
- Basic Information. Name, age, gender, height, build, appearance, clothes, etc. 

### Step 3: Who Are They?
This step dives into the character's personality
- What morals do they value? What attitudes or behaviors do they hate? What are their flaws? What are their quirks, or other interesting characteristics? What are they afraid of? What do they admire most? What makes them angry?
- What do they want? What do they want to accomplish and why? What drives them to do what they do? Do they want to fix something? Are they conflicted? Is there something they want to change? Whatever it is, it should be something personal to them. It can tie into their character gimmick (a liar lied too much and got in trouble).
- What you hope to do in this campaign? (character arc, find out something about their backstory, get something, etc.)
- (optional but cool) What's their visual motif? Something that can easily identify them and their aesthetic. (fire, water, dust, flowers, gold, etc.) Does their equipment have this motif?
- (optional but cool) What's their theme song? When do you want it to play?

### Step 4: Why Are They Like That?
This step is about their origins.
- Where did they grow up? What was their childhood like? Family / friends? Were they rich / poor? Foreign / native? Do they have old wounds, scars, or disabilities? Why are they the class (or classes) that you chose? How does their species factor into everything? 

### Step 5: DND Stats
This step makes the character real and playable in the DND world. 

**Simple Stats**
- Ability scores. There are 6 ability scores: strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. Assign them using the standard array of 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8. You can increase a few of them depending on their background. Ask the DM if you want to do something different. 
- Ability modifiers. Each ability you have will give you a different modifier depending on how high or low it is. 
![[Ability Scores Reference.png]]
- Speed. Your speed is determined by your species. 
- Proficiency Bonus. Determined by your class. 
- Initiative Bonus. Equal to your dexterity modifier. 
- Passive Perception. Your passive perception is equal to 10 plus your wisdom modifier. 

**Equipment**
- Starting gear. Your class and background both give you starting equipment. Add it to your inventory. 
- Your characters can *absolutely* start with unique or personalized items! Message me if you've got ideas!
- AC. Your AC (defense) depends on your armor. If you're unarmored, certain classes give you different ACs. If your class doesn't give you any unarmored defense, then your AC equals 10 plus your dexterity modifier. 

**Complex Stats**
- HP. Your class determines the amount of health you gain per level. Find your classes "hit-die" and roll it a number of times equal to your level. Then add a number equal to your constitution modifier multiplied by your level to your HP. (Hit Die * Level + CON * Level)
- Proficiencies. What skills you're proficient with is determined by your species, class, and background. Go to each of them, find the options you can choose from, choose, and add the proficiencies to your sheet. If you are proficient with a weapon, tool, or language, add it to the "other proficiencies and languages" section. 
- Skill Modifiers. Each skill inherits from one of the six ability scores. Your modifier for that skill is going to be equal to the modifier from the ability it inherits from. If you are proficient in that skill, the skill modifier increases by your proficiency bonus. 
- Saving Throws. Which saving throws you are proficient in are determined by your class. The modifier for your saving throws are equal to the modifier they're named after. If you are proficient in a saving throw, its modifier increases by your proficiency bonus. 

**Spellcaster Exclusive**
I've rewritten the magic system to dodge spiritism, but for ease of understanding I'm going to use the premade terminology. Spellcasters or other magic users have special stats that need to be tracked. 
- Spell Ability Modifier. An ability score used for your spellcasting. Determined by your class.
- Spell Save DC. Equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spell ability modifier. Determined how difficult your spells are to avoid. 
- Spell Attack Modifier. Equal to your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier. Some spells require you to roll to hit like weapons, this is the modifier you'd use for those spells.
- Spell Slots. Think of them less like "slots" and more like ammo. There are 9 levels of spells, and you have a set number of "slots" for each level that you can expend each long rest. These are determined by your class. You also need to track how many you've used. 

**Abilities**
Abilities are more complicated. Your species, class, and background feat all give you special traits. The way you track these is up to you. Here are some common ways:
- Ability Sheet (recommended). Get some pieces of notebook paper, and write down what each one does in list format. 
- Ability Cards. You can write down each ability on an index card, and keep a deck on hand for quick reference. 
- By memory. This is for the most experienced players out there.

**Weapons and Spells**
The weapons and spells your characters acquire each have unique properties. These are very important when in combat, so having some way to track them is important. The properties you need to know for weapons are as follows:
- The name of the weapon
- The damage the weapon deals
- The type of damage the weapon deals
- The type of weapon it is (Simple melee, simple ranged, martial melee, or martial ranged)
- The properties of the weapon (hit modifiers, heavy, finesse, etc.)
- The range of the weapon (melee weapons default to 5ft)
- Any costs the weapon has (ammo, spell slots, etc.)

The properties you need to know for spells are as follows:
- The name of the spell
- The level of the spell
- The effect of the spell
- Any costs or requirements

### Step 6: Review
This step is for double checking your character won't be disruptive!
- Read the rules of your campaign!
- Make adjustments for your campaign!

**Green Flags**
- Weird, out-there, or fun ideas. A talking bear, a 9ft orc rogue, a luchador, a signature weapon that grows in power, a signature vehicle, etc.
- Giving them hobbies or passions.
- Knowing how they'd operate in interaction, combat, and exploration.
- Talking to other players ahead of time to plan your dynamic better.
- Someone the majority of the other players won't strongly dislike.

**Red Flags**
- The big 3: Perverse, Violent, or Antisocial
- Characters that are content with everything and have no conflict. 
- Making yourself but cooler
- Making your need before your want. Don't plan out character arcs before the campaign, because things are unpredictable. 
- Flaws that aren't really flaws (too cool, cares too much, etc.)
- Making an existing character from some other piece of media (more of a starting point)
- Lone wolf, extremely shy, aggressive, batman, etc. Anyone bad at talking.
- Characters that don't really work for the campaign setting. (Spiderman in a political thriller)
- "Evil" characters who do bad things for the sake of it
- Perfect characters (that's boring--flaws are what make characters interesting)
- Murder Hobos, sociopaths, etc.

### Step 7: Finalize
Send me a summary of your character! Something like the following:
- Level:
- Species:
- Class:
- Background:
- Summary of personality:
- Summary of backstory:
- Summary of goals, and what you want them to do in the campaign
