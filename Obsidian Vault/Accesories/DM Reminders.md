**Impartiality and Player Agency**
- If a player wishes to do something, it's your duty to remain impartial.
- Player agency makes the game great!
- Don't tell them where to go, or what to do.

**Goal for Next Session**
At the end of each session, gather notes on what you want the players to do next game.

**Don't be Violent**
It's clear that this group tends to be a bit more graphic when describing how they kill their victims, which may make others uncomfortable. 

**Encourage Players and Roleplay**
A simple "hell yeah" goes a long way. If they do something you like, say you like it, and (if it's really good) give them inspiration.
