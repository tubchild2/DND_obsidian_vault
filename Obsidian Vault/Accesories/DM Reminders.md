**Impartiality and Player Agency**
- If a player wishes to do something, it's your duty to remain impartial.
- Player agency makes the game great!
- Don't tell them where to go, or what to do.

**Goal for Next Session**
At the end of each session, gather notes on what you want the players to do next game.

**Don't be Violent**
It's clear that this group tends to be a bit more graphic when describing how they kill their victims, which may make others uncomfortable. Save violence for impactful moments like important victories or deaths. 

**Encourage Players and Roleplay**
A simple "hell yeah" goes a long way. If they do something you like, say you like it, and (if it's really good) give them inspiration. 

**Narrate Slow**
For impactful moments, slow down and let the words come to you.

**THE ROLE OF THE DICE**
While yes you can fudge dice rolls, your responsibility is to see what the narrative consequences of the mistake are, not how to cushion the blow.  

**Players are Cool**
If the players come up with something that's so much cooler than what you had planned, you can *sparingly* change some things. 

**Implement Battlefield Actions**
Battlefield actions actions happen at the end of the monster's turn, and provide a tell for what they're going to do next turn. This gives the players a chance to adapt and dynamically interact with them to neutralize the action. They come in many shapes and sizes.
