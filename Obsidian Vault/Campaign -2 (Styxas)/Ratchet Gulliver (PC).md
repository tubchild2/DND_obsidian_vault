## Lore and Roleplay
**Personality**
- **Determined and Busy**. Doesn't like improvising. He wants to stick to his plans, but will deviate according to his conscience. He doesn't like wasting time. 
- **Curious**: Loves learning and doesn't like unanswered questions. Naturally investigative. 
- **Good hearted**: He has a good sense of morality and wants to help people where possible. 
- **Bookish**: Loves reading books and wants to learn more about his craft and the world around him. 
- **Sailor:** Grew up sailing, and finds it quite relaxing. 
- **Collector:** Likes collecting trinkets and various weapons. 
- **Book Smart**. Spent most of his life travelling from place to place, being isolated, or reading. However, he's fairly knowledgeable about the world, and very knowledgeable when it comes to ether. 
- **Detached**. Isn't loyal to a flag or creed. I.E. He's free spirited. He prefers to focus on the individual, and is typically unaware of larger conflicts. He stays out of them unless he can realistically make a difference. Because of this, he's bad with money, since he never took it crazy seriously in the first place. He was more of a self-sufficient type of guy anyways. 
- **Empathetic**. He doesn't kill, unless the people are murderers. He's always willing to negotiate though, and won't kill unless people either attack him, refuse to negotiate, or if they're pirates.
- **Naïve and Soft**. Always assumes the best, and is too trusting. He's a pushover. People can take advantage of him with very little effort. Doesn't like to be assertive. 
- **Analysis Paralysis.** Prefers to tackle obstacles tactically, so he might get caught up in thought. 
- **Cowardly and Stressed.** Ratchet is easily startled following his near death experience--especially around babies, bugs, and caves. He avoids putting himself at risk and is highly stressed about his limited power.

**Backstory**
- **A Family of Merchants.** Ratchet was born aboard his parents brigantine in the *Great Saline Sea*. Ratchet's parents were merchants that would buy and resell regional objects to other kingdoms for a handsome profit. Due to travelling so much, they weren't attached to any kingdom, and spent most of their time on the sea in their brigantine. Their ship (and business) was called the Saline Tide. It was an old weathered ship that had seen better days. It was 3 generations old at this point, meaning it needed frequent repairs.
- **Ma and Pa**. Ratchet's (Garrick Gulliver) father was a stout man who enjoyed fishing and sailing, while his mother (Anna Gulliver) was a free-spirited and curious woman that enjoyed reading and travelling. He picked up an appreciation for all these things from a young age. They made their own fun aboard the ship. They told legends, read books, went fishing, collected trinkets, and played games. It was a simple life. They weren't rich rich by any means, but were mostly self-reliant. 
- **Curious and Well Read.** Due to sailing with his parents, he spent his teen years travelling from manors to monasteries, making deals to access their libraries. He picked up a thing or two, and started tinkering with e-tech as a hobby. He was allowed to explore the towns they stayed in as long as he was careful and came back early. 
- **Davy Jones' Locker.** His parents were going to dock in *Styxas*. While a day's journey off from *Nagoyor Port*, they spotted the black and Jacinth sails of pirates. They attempted to flee, but to the dismay of everyone on board, the Pirates were of a higher caliber than previously thought--they had a Kraken under their command. Its tentacles ripped his parents from the ship and pulled them into the waters below. The Pirates boarded the ship and began emptying it. Ratchet hid in a barrel, and peered through a small hole, where he spotted the captain. It was a horned dragonborn wearing a black leather outfit with a Jacinth eye on it. After returning to their ship the brigantine was smashed clean in two by the Kraken, and Ratchet plummeted into the *Ocean Wide*. Suddenly, he felt a flood of ether surge through him as his Folcryst Gland activated. Using mage hand and mending, he swam above the waves and fashioned a raft.  
- **A New Home**. After floating to shore, he bought himself a small sloop to live out of. It's currently docked in *Nagoyor Port*. His sloop is called the Saline Tide after his parent's brigantine. It's been 6 years since the encounter with the kraken, and he's been exploring Styxas to further his plan.
- **Near Death Experience.** After escaping *The Caves of Demise*, he wandered the *Eastern Desert Vast* with his new band of friends and adventurers. After stumbling into an abandoned sand dwarf city, he encountered a horrifying sight. In front of him stand the corpse of a failed experiment; there sat a 40ft baby riddled with oversized maggots and worms. The swarms of flies overpowered him, and his heart stopped for 30 seconds. If not for some powerful words of assurance from their bard, he would've died. This experience forever changed Ratchet, who suddenly valued his life more than ever. He developed a fear of bugs, babies, and caves. Additionally, he stopped trying to help the people who do the work; he stopped letting himself be vulnerable in combat; he stopped searching for a weapon and became the weapon himself. He'd become a burster!

**Agenda**

2. Find a way to neutralize a kraken.
3. Gain enough combat and adventuring experience to outmatch the pirates.
4. Learn the identities of the pirates. Find out why they raided them.
5. Neutralize the kraken, then take out the pirates himself.
