# The Rules of Everything
### The True Nature of Existence
Existence is a dream powered by thought. The difference between the tangible and abstract is less real than you'd think. The sleeper (an entity of unknown origin, purpose, or limitation) perpetuates the multiverse via its dream. Each realm of existence represents a different aspect of the Sleeper's mind, and serves a different function in the ethos of creation. 
### The Realms
There are different types of realms: some realms are physical and others are abstract. I.E. some are [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] based and some are matter based. Each realm operates on its own laws of physics. However, time applies to all realms. 
### The Barrier
The realms are separated by an abstract divider known as the barrier. The barrier has three major properties: 
1. Enforcement: how strong the division between worlds is. Weaker barriers allow for semi-abstract worlds, cross-realm travel, etc. 
2. Toughness: how much it takes to damage the barrier. Typically, the barrier can punctured by objects of immense physical or abstract power. 
3. Durability: how much damage the barrier can sustain before breaking altogether. Breaking the barrier causes the cataclysm. 
### The Cataclysm
If the barrier shatters, the realms lose their separation and begin to deconstruct. This event is known as the cataclysm. All life, be it organic or not, does not survive the cataclysm. Due to time being omnipresent, the events leading up to the cataclysm and the cataclysm itself are both cannon.
### The Reset and the Cycles
After a nanosecond of cataclysmic deconstruction, the Sleepers' dream restarts. This begins a new cycle. The reset doesn't destroy and recreate existence; instead, it recycles what came before in new combinations. Some cycles recycle more than others. Objects of immense power are more likely to survive the cataclysm. Each cycle has barriers with different properties, and they vary greatly depending on the nature of the cycle. No one knows how many cycles there've been, or what cycle their currently on. The fact is, at some point, the dream began, but knowing when is impossible. 
### Key Items
Some items of immense abstract or physical power can become resistant to the cataclysm, allowing them to exist in all subsequent cycles. The only items capable of doing this are ones of either extreme [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] concentration, or extreme energy conservation.
