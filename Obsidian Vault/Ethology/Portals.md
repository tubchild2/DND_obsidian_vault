**General Information**
- **A Link Between Worlds.** A portal is a wormhole that connects 2 [[The True Nature of Existence|realms]]. They're a puncture in spacetime kept open around a remarkably power-dense object ([[Ether]] or Energy).
- **Common Practice for the Energy-Dense Method.** Due to already flexing spacetime and being capable of storing absurd amounts of energy, [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] is commonly used. The amount you'd need depends on the enforcement of the [[The True Nature of Existence|realm]]. 
- **Common Practice for the [[Ether]]-Dense Method.** Due to allowing functionally infinite [[Ether]] storage, high-grade [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] nodes are commonly used. The grade you'd need depends on the enforcement of the [[The True Nature of Existence|realm]].
- **Appearance.** The appearance of portals opened via the energy method appear like perfectly flat holes with no extra designs whatsoever. Portals opened via the [[ether]] method can take on a wide variety of shapes and sizes due to being more fantastical in nature.
