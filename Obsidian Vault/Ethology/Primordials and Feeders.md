### Primordials
**General Information**
- **They Represent an Idea (Thesis).** Primordials form when [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] of a similar idea collects in high volumes. Thus, they represent the central idea of said [[Ether and Unether|Ether]]. This is called their "thesis". 
- **Thesis Dominance.** Once a Primordial forms, it monopolizes its thesis. All [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] related to said thesis is pulled directly to it due to [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] gravity.
- **Knows What it Formed From.** [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] contains a lot of information, and all of it can be read and processed by a primordial. 
- **Dies on Low [[Ether and Unether|Ether]].** If a Primordial runs out of [[Ether and Unether|Ether]], it collapses in on itself and dies.
- **Native to [[Caldwell's Field]].** Due to being made of [[Ether and Unether|Ether]], they cannot physically exist in the universe.
- **Appearance.** They resemble serpents and webs of streaming [[Ether and Unether|Ether]].
- **Agenda / Propagation.** Primordials die if their thesis is forgotten, so it's in their best interest to spread the idea, and get as many people to think of it as possible. This is their only real goal.

**Archaic and Complex Primordials**
- **Two Types of Theses.** Theses typically fall on a spectrum between two extremes. 
- **Archaic Theses / Primordials.** Theses that are ancient, primal, and simple. They carry vast surpluses of [[Ether and Unether|Ether]], but the constant overstimulation of so much information leaves them functionally braindead. Their minds are reduced to nothing but simple algorithms. They aren't even aware of their own existence. 
- **Complex Theses / Primordials.** Theses that are abstract, nuanced, and unnatural. They have significantly less [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] on hand, but this gives them the mental leeway to think. They're incredibly intelligent, but weaker.
- **[[Caldwell's Field]] Local.** They cannot enter the universe due to being made of [[Ether and Unether|Ether]].

**Theophany**
- **[[Gateways|Gateway]] Interaction.** If a Primordial were to discover a [[Gateways|gateway]], they could see through it, sense what's around it, and use their [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] to manifest whatever they want out of it. It's not challenging to prevent other primordials from using a [[Gateways|gateway]] if you get to it first, since differing [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] particles push away from each other. 
- **Creating a Puppet.** By using their [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] to move and maintain their [[Gateways|gateway]], they can give themselves a mobile point of influence. They can wrap these points of influence in physical bodies to protect them if they wish. These mobile points of influence are called "Theophany."

### Feeders
**General Information**
- **They Represent a Debt.** They form when [[Ether and Unether|Unether]] collects in high volumes. Thus, they exist to pay off its debt, and destroy the appropriate amount of matter. See "[[Ethology Reference Table]]" for debts, and how they relate to the Feeder Class. 
- **Can Stifle its Destructive Capabilities.** They can intensify their anti-gravity at will, allowing them to repel enough matter to simulate collision. They can choose to interact with objects without destroying them.
- **Limited Intelligence / Agenda.** They aren't remarkably intelligent, but they're smart enough to target sources of [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] to prevent further debts from forming. 
- **Powerful Beasts.** They can shapeshift into any number of diverse physical forms, can fly infinitely (even in space), can sense [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] sources, have excellent vision and hearing, and are incredibly strong and ferocious. 
- **Killing a Feeder.** They only way to destroy one is to add enough matter and energy to it that its [[Ether and Unether|Unether]] cancels out and vanishes. 
- **Universe Local.** They cannot enter [[Caldwell's Field]] due to being made of [[Ether and Unether|Unether]].
