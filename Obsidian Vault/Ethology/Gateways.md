**General Information**
- **A Link Between Worlds.** A gateway is a wormhole that connects [[Caldwell's Field]] to the universe. They're a tear in spacetime kept open around a remarkably energy dense object. 
- **Mater and [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] Exchange.** [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] rapidly forms on the side of [[Caldwell's Field]], as matter enters the gateway. Matter and Energy rapidly form as [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] exits the gateway.
- **[[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] is Commonly Used.** Due to already flexing spacetime and being capable of storing absurd amounts of energy, [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] is commonly used. To open a gateway, you'd likely need 20+ cubic feet of highly energized [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]]. 
- **Appearance and Measurements.** Gateways appear like a perfectly flat circle, with a rim of light and energy. The diameter of a portal is calculated using the dimensions (in feet) of the energy dense object keeping it open (E). Length + Width + Height = Diameter.
