# Pre-Session 
### Plot/Goals  
Part 1: The Setup
- "Welcome aboard the Lightning-55. You're all part of a crew of old-world scavengers; your primary job is to loot the ruins of the frontier worlds, but you'll take just about whatever job if it means you can stay afloat. 2 days ago, you received a job from Dr. Jack Matheny, who promised an exorbitant 50 thousand credits in exchange for an incredibly basic job. He couldn't provide more details, so he requested that you meet him on Venus. You've been on your way since. Really quickly, let's introduce characters."
- Introduce players. Plant seeds of doubt centered around those secrets they created.

Part 2: Venus
- Your ship creakily docks on the desert world of Venus. Vegetation is nowhere to be seen, thick clouds of sand and dust whip up into your eyes and mouth, and the locals are caked in layers of dirt and cloth to block the heated sandstorms. In front of you sits the ruins of Ashwick; a once prosperous town now reduced to a handful of dried wooden structures, and a population below 50. Dr. Matheny is reportedly waiting inside a bar called "The Tumbleweed."
- Dr. Matheny introduces himself, and invites them to sit. Though the nature of the mission is largely classified, he's offering a whopping 50,000 credits for a basic 7 day trip from Venus to Neptune. He's transporting something that he can't disclose, and he requires that no questions be asked.
- If they accept, he takes them into a private room in the back and pulls a series of rugs off a surface in the back. Hidden under them, was a large obsidian chest with 6 large purple metal locks. The crate has several vents on the sides that occasionally pulse with purple or golden light. A dense gas slowly trickles out of vents. He needs to move it into his room on the ship. The money will remain on his person until they arrive on Neptune.

Part 3: The Ship
- Introduce them to the functionality of the ship. (See [[The Lightning-55 (DOC)]])
- Let them explore the ship
	- Point out unimportant things that people are doing in a way the seems like they possess greater significance.
	- Imply secrets being kept between the GM and the players beyond the standard ones.
	- Start rumors. Dr. Matheny says things like, "I know what kind of man you really are." or "I know how you think."
	- Plant ambiguous evidence / unresolved details. 
		- There's a bunch of meat in the fridge that's leaking blood.
		- There's a half burned note in the trash.
		- There are scratch or knife marks outside the vent covers.
		- There's a full katana lying across the floor of the engine room.
		- There's a trail of water droplets around the escape pod.
- Dinner Time
	- Dr. Matheny cooks chicken for everyone.
	- Dr. Matheny is quiet, and then he asks everyone what their biggest fears are.
		- "What's your greatest fear, Dr. Matheny?"
			- "When I was a child, I used to listen to the signals from space at night up on the hill by my home. One night, I overheard something from far beyond the solar system, something impossibly old. It sounded human, like a distress call. Someone was calling to me from the deep, but there couldn't have been anyone out there. I didn't sleep that night. So, what scares me, is the idea that there's something out there I'll never understand; that there's something so horrible and so powerful that it could mess with me like that. The space beyond the solar system is what scares me."
	- Dr. Matheny asks some small talk questions
		- Do you have any rivals?
			- "Do you have any rivals, Dr. Matheny?"
				- "Oh yes. As a scientist I often find that there are many people interested in stealing what I've made. Obviously I can't share the details, but House Arai has attempted to steal my work countless times. That's why I have to be careful about protecting it. I may not be a good man, but I know that giving something like that to them is wrong."
		- How long have you all been scavengers? 
		- What's the craziest job you've ever been on?


Part 4: The Inciting Incident
- I thought it might be fun if we do something a little different here. It's getting late and it's about time everyone will head to bed. Each player is going to get a chance to privately do however many things they want to before going to bed. This is the only time you'll be able to do something without your fellow players actively observing you.
	- How this is going to work is everyone message me a few things you want to do (in case of overlap), and then I'll talk to each of you privately and say what you find. I'll give each player 6 minutes. Keep your stats on you because you'll likely need to make checks even if someone else is going. If you do, keep it discreet and don't tell anyone.

- Events
	1. You hear footsteps beyond your line of sight. Someone was observing you and sprinted away.
	2. You hear a faint beeping red light coming from the ship's radio in the console room. Somebody just contacted the confederacy, they told them about the cargo, the position of the ship, and who's on board. The confederacy is on their way, and will arrive at their position in an hour. They have you outgunned and outnumbered. They will imprison, enslave, or execute everyone on board.
	3. You hear muffled screaming coming the bedrooms. It appears Dr. Matheny's room door was left half-opened. Dr. Matheny's bloodied corpse lies sprawled across the floor. He was stabbed to death in his room. All of his credits are gone, the weapon was taken, and the metal box he was carrying has been opened and emptied.
	4. You see all of the ship's cameras and lights simultaneously power down. Someone erased the security camera footage, and disabled them.
	5. You hear the engine power down and the ship halt in place. Someone used the Captain's lock to disable the engine. They changed the password. It can't be hacked without damaging the ship.
	6. You notice the sound of a muffled conversation through the ventilation system. Two people are fiercely arguing, but you can't discern what they're saying.
- Gather the crew back together.

Part 5: The Witch Hunt
- "I've been taking notes on the situation, and if my notes are correct, I think this is "
	- Someone aboard the ship disabled the engine and changed the password, locking your ship in space.
	- This individual then entered Dr. Matheny's room, killed him, stole the 50,000 credits, and emptied his cargo.
	- Then, wanting to cover their tracks, they took out the ship's cameras and lights, and erased the footage.
	- Finally, they contacted the Confederacy. They told them about something illegal, and now they're on their way.
	- The confederacy is going to board your ship in one hour, and you'll be severely outmatched.
- From my perspective, as the GM, you have a few options:
	- You can figure out who did it and either execute them with the airlock, leave them behind with the escape, or try to get the engine password out of them to get the ship moving.
	- You can hunker down and attempt to fight off the confederacy as a team with a severe disadvantage.
	- Or you can turn on each other and take the pod for yourselves, dooming everyone else on board.
- Start the 1 hour real-time timer.
- Don't reveal any more info because that's meta gaming.
- The session ends when the timer runs out because "I didn't plan for this."
