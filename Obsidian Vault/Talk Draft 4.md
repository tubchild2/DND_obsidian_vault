**INTRODUCTION**

There's an old saying, maybe you've heard it before, "You never really know something until you teach it to someone else." Now, besides Brother Myeri, how many of us would be confident teaching about prophecy on the spot?

Prophecy is no doubt one of the most important parts of our faith, especially today, but at times, it can feel cryptic, or complicated, or challenging to fully wrap your head around without a deep knowledge of the Bible.

So, in this discussion we're going to briefly answer two questions: what is prophecy, and how were prophecies received?


**WHAT IS PROPHECY**
116 seconds

**Let's start with what prophecy is**. At first, many might assume it's essentially a prediction about the future from God. However, contrary to popular belief, prophecy doesn't necessarily have to involve foretelling the future, and there are many instances where it doesn't. 

A great example of this is found in Judges 6 and verse 7. If you recall, during this time the Israelites were distressed because of the actions of the Midianites, so they were calling to Jehovah for help, however, they were also practicing false worship at the time. Judges chapter 6 starting in verse 7. it says, 
"When the Israelites called to Jehovah for help because of Midʹi·an, Jehovah sent to the Israelites a prophet who said to them “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, ‘I brought you up from Egypt and thus brought you out of the house of slavery." and then verse 10 says, "And I said to you: “I am Jehovah your God. You must not fear the gods of the Amʹor·ites in whose land you are dwelling.” But you did not obey me.’”"

So, what was going on here? In response to the Israelite's call for help, Jehovah sent one of his prophets to explain that they wouldn't receive Jehovah's help because they were practicing false worship. The prophet wasn't alluding to the future at all, and yet the verse still calls the man a prophet. 

So if prophecy doesn't have to involve foretelling the future, what is it exactly? The Bible provides an answer at 2 Peter 1:20, 21, turn with me there if you'd like. 2 Peter 1:20, 21. It says,
"For you know this first, that *no* prophecy of Scripture springs from any *private interpretation*. For prophecy was at *no time* brought by *man's will*, but men spoke *from god* as they were moved by holy spirit."
Did you catch that last part where it said that men spoke *from* god? That would from imply that the words they were speaking originated with God. So, prophecy, then, is a message inspired by God, or a divine revelation.


**WHAT ARE SOME DIFFERENT WAYS PROPHETS RECEIVED MESSAGES FROM GOD**

But how did the prophets receive messages from God?

We're going through Isaiah, so I thought a good place to start were with visions. If you recall, in Isaiah chapter 6, Isaiah had a vision of the Seraphim, and spoke to the voice of Jehovah. Visions like these were so vivid that the prophet could participate in them. According to Acts 10:10, some of the visions were transmitted while the prophet was in a trance. Others were conveyed via dreams, like King Belshazzar's dreams that Daniel interpreted. 

We also know Jehovah directly supplied written works to his people. This happened at least once with the ten commandments, but is evidently a much rarer form of communication.

Besides those, many prophets were mentally guided by God to convey his messages. **According to 2 Timothy 3:16, that's what happened with the writers of the Bible**. That verse tells us that "all scripture is inspired of God". The phrase, "inspired of God" can also be rendered as, "God-breathed." So, God used his holy spirit to sort of "breathe" his ideas into the minds of the Bible writers. In other words, he guided their thoughts, allowing the prophets to use their own wording, but to transmit God's messages. One way to think about this is like the owner of a company having to deliver a message to all of his employees, and he'll do it through his managers. Each manager will likely phrase it in their own unique way, but the core, important ideas, will remain intact. 

Lastly, on some occasions, Jehovah sent Angelic messengers to directly communicate with the prophets when precise wording was important. Jehovah did this many times. In Exodus 3:2-4, Jehovah communicated with Moses through an angel in the burning bush. In Luke 1:28-30 the Angel Gabriel visited Mary to tell her that she'd become pregnant with Jesus. And there are many more examples like these.


**CONCLUSION**

So, if you think back to the beginning of this talk, we sought to find the answer to two questions. First, what is prophecy, and second, how did it happen in the Bible? 

We saw in 2 Peter 1:20, 21 that prophecy was any message inspired by God. And we saw that the Bible showcased many ways Jehovah communicated with his prophets, including writing, angelic messengers, visions, and mental guidance. 

Hopefully now, if someone asks you to teach them about prophecy, you can do it with more confidence, and give them an accurate answer that comes right from the Bible.
