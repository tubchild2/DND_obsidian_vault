### General Info
Set in the far future of the "Will of [[Primordial of Order|Tod]]" campaign. It's set 20 years after the campaign. 

Something serious went down in between the last 20 years, because there are [[Primordials and Feeders|feeders]] and [[Primordials and Feeders|primordials]] everywhere. The world has gone to chaos. 

Canonically, this is what happened in this future:
	[[Primordial of Order|Tod]] ([[Primordial of Order|the primordial of order]]), managed to acquire [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] and open a gate to build more [[Primordials and Feeders|Theophany]]. He brought in loyal [[Primordials and Feeders|Primordials]] to enforce his order, and succeeded in overthrowing [[The Galaxy]] using his network of elites from across [[The Galaxy]]. 
	Then, the [[Hyperbeings]] banded together to summon a rogue [[Primordials and Feeders|Theophany]]. They stood no chance at defeating a [[Primordials and Feeders|primordial]], especially one as intelligent and militarily powerful as [[Primordial of Order|Tod]]. However, they hoped that manifesting the [[Primordials and Feeders|theophany]] of the [[Primordials and Feeders|primordial]] of Chaos, they count counteract [[Primordial of Order|Tod]]'s regime with his exact opposite. 
	The plan backfired, and the [[Primordials and Feeders|Primordial]] of Chaos immediately slaughtered the collected [[Hyperbeings]], and used their [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] blood to create a new [[Gateways|Gateway]], one which he kept open to allow as many [[Primordials and Feeders|Theophany]] to form as possible.
	With all the [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] debt being created, [[Primordials and Feeders|Feeders]] began populating the universe, and an everlasting war between the [[Primordials and Feeders|Primordials]] and them began.
	Intelligent life was caught in the crossfire. Their empires crumbled, their environments rewritten, and their lines of communications destroyed, they had no means of fighting back. They were left to scavenge, and try to make a life out of nothing.
