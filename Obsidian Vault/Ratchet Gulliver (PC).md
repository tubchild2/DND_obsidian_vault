### Backstory
- **Raised on the Sea.** Ratchet's parents were seafaring merchants and transporters. Early life was spent learning to sale and read. 
- **Curious and Well Read.** He spent his teen years travelling from manors to monasteries with his parents, making deals to access their libraries. He picked up a thing or two, and started tinkering as a hobby.
- **Orphaned at Sea.** His parents were given the task to escort black sapphires to nobility in Terragon. Halfway through the trip, they were attacked by pirates with a kraken under their command. His parents were killed, and he barely escaped by using mage hand and mending to fashion a raft.
- **A New Home**. He bought himself a small sloop, and has lived out of that ever since. Well, it's his home base, but he's rarely home due to his travels to complete his plan.  
- **His Plan**. 
	- Step 1: Research and find the schematics for an ancient elvish kraken weapon.
