My goal is to create a user friendly program that provides the following feature:
- RPGE Maker Mode. Allows you to define and save features, properties, backgrounds, classes, species, skills, and items into libraries in the RPGE File Format to allow them to be easily shared and imported. You can additionally use this mode to modify other's libraries and save different copies of them.
- RPGE Campaign Maker Mode. Allows you to create a campaign by combining libraries with brief descriptions. Saves these libraries into folders on your computer.
- RPGE Player Maker Mode. Allows you to create characters using the libraries from an imported or selected campaign. Saves the character as an easily copied string of text, or to a text file.  

Maker Mode lets you create and edit Library files. Each contains:
