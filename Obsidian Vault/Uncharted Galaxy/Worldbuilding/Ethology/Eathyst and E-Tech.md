### Eathyst
**General Information**
- **Eathyst Leaks [[Ether and Unether|Ether]].** Eathyst is a crystalline substance that leaks unprogrammed [[Ether and Unether|Ether]]. It does this because it contains millions of subatomic puncture points in spacetime. They're not even close to being big or stable enough to be considered [[Gateways]].
- **Eathyst Forms Around Weak Points.** Around [[Gateways]] or other weak points in space time, nearly infinitely small puncture points form. These occasionally leak [[Ether and Unether|Ether]], which manifests to form a golden crystalline structure.
- **[[Ether and Unether|Ether]] Stabilization.** The local pocket of bent space time allows [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] to temporarily resist manifesting until outside of the Eathyst.
- **Electrical Response.** Eathyst is highly conductive, and will leak [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] when exposed to electricity. Advanced computers can send extremely precise signals that emulate brainwaves, and essentially program the [[Ether and Unether|Ether]]'s idea.
- **[[Ethology Reference Table|Pyte]]-Rate (PPH) and Grade.** The [[Ethology Reference Table|Pytes]] of [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] Eathyst produces is called its [[Ethology Reference Table|Pyte]] Rate, and is measured in [[Ethology Reference Table|Pytes]] per Hour (PPH). The scale at which it manages [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] is called its "Grade," which ranges from 1-10. 
- **Raw PPH.** By default, Raw Eathyst has a set PPH / Grade based on its size. (See [[Ethology Reference Table]].)

**Properties**
- Melts at 1,084c
- Boils at 2,562c
- Density: 3g / cm^3
- Worth 375c per gram
- Worth 1125c per cubic centimeter
- Fragile
- Semi-Transparent

**PPH Alterations**
- **PPH Transference.** The PPH of Eathyst can be transferred to and from units of Eathyst, but it cannot be created using this process. When liquified, the Eathyst becomes agitated. If two liquified units of Eathyst are mixed, their puncture points merge together. If liquid Eathyst contacts solid Eathyst, the [[Gateways|gateway]] within the liquid will transfer to it, since it's more stable. However you do it, you can combine Eathyst PPH to create higher *grade* Eathyst. (See [[Ethology Reference Table]].)
- **PPH Increases.** The PPH of Eathyst increases very slowly with use. Most E-Tech only uses the Eathyst a couple times per hour due to the slower PPHs in common Eathyst, making this process mostly irrelevant to their tech. However, [[Ether Users]] constantly stimulate their Eathyst, making the process much faster and more integral to their development. 

**Eathyst Farming**
- **Near [[Gateways]].** Eathyst grows much faster around [[Gateways]]. The amount of Eathyst grown per day (in ft^3) is a number equal to half the diameter the nearby [[Gateways|gateway]] (in feet). I.E. a 2ft [[Gateways|gateway]] would produce 1ft^3 of Eathyst per day. A 6ft [[Gateways|gateway]] would produce 3ft^3 of Eathyst per day.
- **Near Weak Points in Spacetime.** A weak point is something extremely energy dense but not approaching reality bending levels, such as a supernova, or a neutron star. Eathyst without a [[Gateways|gateway]] accretes at a much lower rate. For every cubic meter of energy dense material, 1cm^3 of Eathyst secretes per day. This makes Eathyst naturally occurring, but remarkably rare.

### Eathyst Alloys
**Forming Eathyst Alloys**
	By mixing liquified Eathyst with another liquified metal, you can create an Eathyst alloy. Eathyst alloys have the physical traits of the metal, with the PPH of the Eathyst. The trick is to use small Eathyst with a high PPH to preserve as much of the metal as possible. 

**E-Tech Components**
Conductors and Resistors
	Won't produce [[Ether and Unether|Ether]], but will function as an [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] conductor. [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] flows from positive to negative depending on the voltage. [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] has resistance and will cause heat build up, and eventual voltage decay. The amount of [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] the metal can handle without resisting and heating is equal to its grade.
Capacitors. 
	Won't produce [[Ether and Unether|Ether]], but will function as an [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] battery. [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] directed inside of it is held indefinitely. Will leak [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] if exposed to electricity. If the amount of [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] stored is above its grade, it melts.
4D Metals. 
	The PPH of the Eathyst doubles due to bypassing local spacetime restrictions. I.E. the puncture points can get away with leaking much more [[Ether and Unether|Ether]].

**Other Alloys**
Non-Conductive Metals. 
	The PPH of the Eathyst is halved, but it gains the physical properties of the metal. 
Ideological Conductor
	The Eathyst no longer leaks unprogrammed [[Ether and Unether|Ether]]. Instead, it programs itself based on the thoughts of those in its immediate vicinity, with a heavy bias to anyone touching it.

### E-Tech
**The Basics**
	1. **Power Source.** An electrical charge passes into the power source (I.E. Eathyst), which then begins producing [[Ether and Unether|Ether]]. 
	2. **E-Conductor.** To prevent the [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] from erupting from the Eathyst, the [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] from the power source is moved into an [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] conductive alloy. The [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] will flow from positive to negative in the circuit.
	3. **Programmer**. The [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] is programmed via some replicable means.
	4. **Exit Point.** The [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] flows to its desired point, at which it begins to manifest. 

**Systems of Measurement**
1. Voltage. The amount of hypothetical pressure pushing the [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] to move through the circuit.
2. Amperage. The amount of [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] moving.
3. Wattage. The amperage multiplied by the voltage. Represents the amount of "power" you have to work with.
4. Grade (see [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] reference table). A shorthand method of denoting [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] quantity. Can be used to represent conductivity (I.E. how much [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] an alloy can handle), or also how much [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] a unit of Eathyst produces per hour.

**Methods of [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] Programming**
1. **Ideological Programming**. By making use of an ideological conductor, you can surround the [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] with similar ideas for it to conduct when manifesting. It'll conduct ideas in close proximity to it best, so physically attaching the Eathyst to what you want can help. 
2. **Quantum Programming**. By making use of unprogrammed [[Ether and Unether|Ether]], you can manually reprogram it with a quantum supercomputer, and nothing less.
3. **Biological Programming**. Intelligent life can use Eathyst connected to their bodies to program it via their thought (ala [[Ether Users]]). By genetically modifying something that can think one thought, you could have it consistently produce a desired outcome.
