### Ether
**General Information**
- **Contains Quantum Soup that Represents an Idea.** Ether is a particle native to [[Caldwell's Field]] that stores raw information. It contains a soup of compressed subatomic particles in a superposition between matter and energy. An idea is implanted into this particle, and the soup inside shifts to contain it. A single particle can store petabytes of information.
- **Forms Whenever Something Thinks.** Ether forms from thought. Whenever something in the universe thinks, a new particle of Ether forms in [[Caldwell's Field]] to represent that idea and its surrounding context. [[Ether users]] bypass this to form Ether in their world, but this is unnatural and uncommon. 
- **Ideological Magnetism.** Ether particles with similar ideas attract one another, and vice versa. They generate a north and south pole, one aligning with the dominant programmed Ether, and the other repelling opposite ideologies.
- **Ether in the Universe.** Whenever an Ether particle enters the universe, the quantum soup's superposition collapses, causing it to form matter and energy that represent whatever idea it was storing. This process is called "manifestation," because the idea it represented manifests in our world. Unprogrammed Ether, or Ether that stores no information, conducts nearby ideas and manifests that. It takes roughly a second to manifest. 
- **Matter / Energy in [[Caldwell's Field]].** The opposite applies too. Whenever matter or energy enter [[Caldwell's Field]], they form a quantum soup and convert into Ether.
- **High Concentrations.** Whenever Ether of a similar type collects, it can form a [[Primordials and Feeders|Primordial]]. 
- **Measured in [[Ethology Reference Table|Pytes]].** See "[[Ethology Reference Table]]" for measurements of Ether, and the scale of their subsequent effects.

### Unether
**General Information**
- **Forms Whenever Ether Manifests.** The law of conservation of mass and the law of conservation of energy state that matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed. Ether violates this law, so the universe needs to balance the excess creation with negative matter, or Unether. Unether pops into existence at a random point in the universe.
- **Local to the Universe.** It cannot exist in [[Caldwell's Field]], since it's held up by the universe's laws of physics. 
- **Destructive Touch.** Whenever Unether contacts matter or energy, they cancel each other out, and are both permanently destroyed. 
- **Negative Gravity.** It obeys gravitational laws, but inversed. If a dense enough collection of Unether were to exist, objects would be pushed away from it rather than towards it. However, Unether does gravitate towards other Unether. 
- **Debt.** Whenever someone uses Ether, they essentially create a "debt" in Unether. That means that somewhere in the universe, a collection of negative matter forms to counterbalance the amount of matter and energy they created.
- **High Concentrations.** Whenever Unether of a similar type collects, it can form a [[Primordials and Feeders|Feeder]]. 
- **Measured in [[Ethology Reference Table|Pytes]].** See "[[Ethology Reference Table]]" for measurements of Unether, and the scale of their subsequent effects.
