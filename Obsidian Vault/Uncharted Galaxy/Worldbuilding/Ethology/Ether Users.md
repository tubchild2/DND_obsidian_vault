### General Information
- **Definition:** All intelligent life can become [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] users, as all intelligent life produces [[Ether and Unether|Ether]]. The major challenge is learning to form [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] in the physical world, rather than in [[Caldwell's Field]]. It requires a challenging amount of focus to pull off, as you need to think of exactly what you wish to do and then will the [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] into existence. 
- **[[Ether and Unether|Ether]] Potential:** Some races and cultures have higher potential for [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] use than others. However, there's no skill ceiling, meaning even those with lower potential originally can bypass this given practice.
### 5e Changes for [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] Users
- **No Magic**. Magic doesn't exist. Spiritism is impossible, and all traditional 5e magic is replaced by being an [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] user. Spells are still exclusive to certain classes.
- **Terminology changes**:
	- Spells -> Fluxes
	- Spellcasting -> Fluxing
	- Metamagic -> Tuning
- **Class Flavor Changes.** All classes* are [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] users, but their abilities differ as a result of their methods, personalities, and religious or technological affinities. 
	- **CLERICS, WARLOCKS, AND PALADINS**. An important note is that there is no direct communication between the entity clerics, paladins, and warlocks choose to work with / worship. Their existence is ambiguous, but sticking to their religious code absolutely influences their [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] abilities. 
	- **SORCERERS**. Sorcerers are species with higher [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] potential. 
	- **ARTIFICERS**. Artificers are [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] users that can produce [[Eathyst and E-Tech|E-Tech]]. The only item that physically requires the appropriate amount of [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] in-game is a spell-storing item (flux-storing item).
