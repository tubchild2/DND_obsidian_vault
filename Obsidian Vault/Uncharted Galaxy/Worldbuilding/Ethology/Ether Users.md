### General Information
- **Definition.** An [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] user is someone with access to a source of [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] as part of their nervous system, allowing them access to what many would consider magic. Almost all [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] users have [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] directly implanted into their nervous system / blood. This allows them to control it as if it were a muscle.
- **Inheritance.** [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] in blood can be hereditary in high concentrations. 
- **[[Eathyst and E-Tech|PPH]].** The power of an [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] user is measured in their [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]]' [[Eathyst and E-Tech|PPH]]. Due to [[Ether Users]] constantly stimulating their [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]], their [[Eathyst and E-Tech|PPH]] will increase with use. The amount they can do per day entirely depends on their [[Eathyst and E-Tech|PPH]]. 

### 5e Changes for Ether Users
- **No Magic**. Magic doesn't exist. Spiritism is impossible, and all traditional 5e magic is replaced by being an [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] user. Spells are still exclusive to certain classes.
- **Terminology changes**:
	- Spells -> Fluxes
	- Spellcasting -> Fluxing
	- Metamagic -> Tuning
- **Class Flavor Changes.** All classes* are [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] users, but their abilities differ as a result of their methods, personalities, and religious or technological affinities. 
	- **CLERICS, WARLOCKS, AND PALADINS**. An important note is that there is no direct communication between the entity clerics, paladins, and warlocks choose to work with / worship. Their existence is ambiguous, but sticking to their religious code absolutely influences their [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] abilities. 
	- **SORCERERS**. Sorcerers likely inherited the [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] in their blood, or had it accrete in their blood due to spending time near a weakpoint in spacetime. 
	- **ARTIFICERS**. Artificers are [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] users that can produce [[Eathyst and E-Tech|E-Tech]]. The only item that physically requires the appropriate amount of [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] in-game is a spell-storing item (flux-storing item).
