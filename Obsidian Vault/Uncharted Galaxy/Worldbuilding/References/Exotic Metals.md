### Nethrium
**General Information**
- Can be found inside of [[Hyperbeings]]. 
- Must be stored extremely carefully at high temperatures, as it can blind you or release ridiculous amounts of radiation.
- Appearance: solid black, with purple streaks through it. 
- Conductor.
- Noncorrosive. 
- Effective insulator. 

**Properties**
- Worth: ~285,300c / gram
- Worth: ~95,000c / cm^3
- Density: 3g / cm^3
- 4D.
	- It's true structure is beyond our plane of reality. 
	- Impossibly dense, leading to perfect energy distribution. I.E. indestructible and heat-resistant. 
	- Can only be destroyed by something impossibly hot, or by something else 4D
- Melts at 5,600c
- Boils at 150,000c
- Ionizes at 3,000,000c

### Illidium
**General Information**
- Exceptionally durable. It's significantly tougher than steel.
- Heavy metal
- Nonconductor
- Noncorrosive
- Effective insulator
- Typically mined out of asteroids, and the [[Gorviris|great mines of Gorviris]]. 

**Properties**
- Melts at 1,260c
- Density: 7.8 grams per cm^3
- Worth: 30c per gram
- Worth: 234c per cm^3

### Lirillium
**General information**
- Very light. 
- Fairly durable. Akin to bronze.
- Nonconductor
- Noncorrosive

**Properties**
- Melts at 1,085c
- Density: 0.8g/cm^3
- Worth: 16.8c per gram
- Worth: 6c per cm^3



---
### Dravium
**General Information**
- Average weight.
- Fairly durable. Akin to bronze.
- Emits a constant golden light when exposed to air. It slowly sublimates in open air, losing mass over time. It takes about a year of constant exposure for a cm^3 to sublimate.  
- Nonconductor
- Noncorrosive

**Properties**
- Melts at ~1,100c
- Density: ~8.2 g/cm^3
- Worth (per gram): ~9.2c
- Worth (per cm^3): ~75.44c



---
### Umbraphyl 
**General Information**
- Light weight
- Not very durable. Compare to gold.
- Very efficiently absorbs all forms of light and radiation. Pitch black. Invisible in darkness.
- Nonconductor
- Noncorrosive

**Properties**
- Melts at ~1,064c
- Density: ~1.9 g/cm^3
- Worth (per gram): ~50c
- Worth (per cm^3): ~95c



---
### Ravite
**General Information**
- Heavy light-orange steel
- Highly durable. Comparable to steel.
- Conductor
- Noncorrosive
- Can absorb heat, electricity, light, radiation, and force, before expelling them later in a powerful burst.

**Properties**
- Melts at ~1,500c
- Density: 7g / cm^3
- Worth (per gram): ~79c
- Worth (per cm^3): 553c



---
### Uthine
**General Information**
- Medium weight toxic green metal
- Low durability.
- Conductor.
- Noncorrosive.
- Has antigravitational properties. Can alter its weight.

**Properties**
- Melts at ~850c
- Density: ~5.4g / cm^3
- Worth (per gram): 80c
- Worth (per cm^3): 432c
