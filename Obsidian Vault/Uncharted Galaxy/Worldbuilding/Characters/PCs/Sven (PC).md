### Abilities and Stuff
Abilities
- Favored Enemy. Hunter's Mark is always prepared. I can use it (2 times at lvl 3) without expending a slot. 
- Archery (Fighting Style). +2 to attack rolls made for ranged weapons.
- Hunter's Lore. Whenever a creature is marked by Hunter's Mark, you know the creature's immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities. 
- Hunter's Prey (colossus slayer). When you hit a creature with a weapon, the weapon does an extra 1d8 damage if it's missing any hit points. You can do this once per turn.
- Shape Changer. As an action, change your appearance and voice. 
- Savage Attacker. Once per turn, reroll damage dice and take either roll.

LVL 1 Fluxes (3 uses, 4 prepared)
- Longstrider
	Touch a creature. Their speed increases by 10ft for an hour.
- Jump
	Touch a creature. Once per turn, they can jump up to 30ft by spending 10ft of movement. Lasts 1 minute.
- Detect Poison and Disease
	For 10 minutes, you can detect poisons, venoms, and other contagions within 30ft. Blocked by wood, stone, metal, and that kind of thing. I don't intend on using this.
- Cure Wounds
	A creature you touch regains 2d8+3 hp. 
- Hunter's Mark (always prepared as a ranger)
	Mark a creature. For 1 hour, deal 1d6 Force damage to the target when they're hit. You also have advantage on any Perception or Survival checks made to find it.

### Lore and Roleplay
Personality
- **Refined and purposeful.** He does stuff for a purpose. He's a nimble son of a gun.
- **Experienced yet humble.** He knows his own limits, and is fine taking insults from people.
- **Lighthearted and optimistic.** Everything is gonna work always. He's confident that no matter what happens he'll find a way to recover.
- **Grand political/heroic aspirations.** He hates [[House Galling]], and wants to support the [[Heretics]] were possible.
- **Physically fragile, yet bold.** Him and death are chill with one another.

Backstory
- **Born Under Mysterious Circumstances.** Born to changelings somewhere in [[The Galaxy]]. He never knew his parents. As a changeling, he has no culture, no history, no relatives, and no identity. 
- **Frail as all Get Out.** Incredibly fragile due to a bone defect when shapeshifting. 
- **Generally Good.** Raised in a [[Federation]] Orphanage. He was the victim of a lot of mistreatment from a young age. He was a good friend of an [[Illeth]] slave, and didn't buy into the propaganda about them.
- **Heroic Aspirations.** Wanting to make a difference in the world, he joined the [[Federation]] army. On one mission, he was dispatched to kill a band of [[Heretics]]. They turned out to be an [[Illeth]] family that was more scared than anything. The father was wounded, so he carried him to safety.
- **[[Heretics]].** He joined the [[Heretics]], and began collaborating with them on a series of anti-House-Galling / [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] projects. His genetic knack for anonymity gives him a huge advantage on stealth and infiltration missions. He took up archery and learned some practical skills.
- **No Reputation.** Being a changeling makes it impossible to identify him by appearance, voice, mannerisms, or fingerprints. He's done quite a bit in the 7 years he's been active, and none of the crimes would lead anyone to think they're done by the same person. He's fine with this. As it stands, he has no criminal record.

Agenda
- **Be Better.** Help good people, and hurt bad people.

Appearance
- It changes constantly.
- By default: A dark blue cloak, brown leather armor, and a pale face.
