### General Information
- A [[Hyperbeings|hyperbeing]]
- Interested in [[The Party]]
- Unknown motive.

**Functionality**
- If someone rolls a natural 20 perception check, and there's a reasonable buffer between the players and where the man could appear so that they cannot catch him, and he hasn't already appeared in the past 2 [[Session Planning|sessions]], they can briefly notice him observing them from a distance.
- Should he attempt to communicate for whatever reason, it's important to maintain an air of mystery. No information he gives can be directly traced back to him, and his advice is vague at best.
