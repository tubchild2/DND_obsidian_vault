**Backstory**
October 11th 11987
	Dale was born on a farm on Mars. 

August 12006
	Dale joined the army. 

June 12008
	Dale met his future wife Alanna. She was a field medic.

April 12009
	Dale and Alanna got married.

June 12009
	Dale and Alanna finished serving, and set out to make a new life for themselves in [[Vivere Mori]]. Dale would run his own gun store, where he'd sell firearms. They quickly realized how bad that decision was, when Dale had to work 10 hour days, 6 days a week, and they still could barely afford a studio apartment. They scraped by. 

May 12013
	Alanna gave birth to Reed Borland. Dale loved him more than anything else in the world. 

July 12020
	As Reed grew older, Dale took him shooting, read to him, and they did movie nights as a family. Money was tight, but they were a genuinely happy family in a place that's known for misery.

January 14th 12024
	Alanna was confirmed pregnant with a baby girl.

September 8th 12024
	- [[Taure (PC)]], [[Gemini (PC)]], and [[Corvus (PC)]] entered his gun store in the city of [[Vivere Mori]]. Dale and his family were on the eccentric side, but they were happy despite their unfortunate living conditions. Dale was shot twice by [[Gemini (PC)]] and collapsed on the ground. His 11 year old son Reed was the crushed and disemboweled in front of him by [[Taure (PC)]]. Not long after, his wife Alanna was hacked to pieces by [[Gemini (PC)]]. The stress caused her to give birth to their baby girl, who was then bisected by [[Gemini (PC)]]. I'm not making this up, this is what they decided to do on session 2. I hated it. 
	- Dale was taken to a local hospital that same day and received multiple amputations without anesthesia because he couldn't afford it. He lost his arm, half his mouth, 3 of his fingers, and one of his feet. He received plastic bionic implants to replace his lost limbs, and was charged by the hospital for arrival on short notice. An overwhelming sensation of heartbreak settled over him. He mourned his son, and missed him more than anything else in the world. The two of them were going to have a movie marathon that night. He couldn't afford to pay for the hospital bill, so the hospital repossessed his home, his store, his stock, and all of his cash. He spent the night in his ship and spent his time writing letters to his family, letting them know how he's doing, and things he wanted to tell them. 

September 9-12th
	Dale moved into his ship, and began dwelling on [[The Party]]. He stayed up and called [[House Galling]] law enforcement as soon as their office opened, but they just weren't interested in helping him more than the bare minimum. He smashed his phone in a fit of rage. He contemplated ending his own life, but he realized that'd be giving [[The Party]] / those who wronged him what they wanted. No one wanted to do anything, so Dale decided to take matters into his own hands. He'd kill [[The Party]], kill [[Bradford]], and ruin [[House Galling]].

September 13th 
	He began collecting parts and fabricating his own weapons out of his ship. His focus, and expertise made him a devastatingly effective weapon maker. He spent all day every day honing his mind and body. He was already an expert marksman, but he'd need more. 

September 14th
	He constructed an arm to replace the plastic one he got from [[House Galling]]. It had an [[Exotic Metals|Illidium]] structure, with [[Exotic Metals|Ravite]] paneling, and a [[Exotic Metals|Uthine]] core. It's very heavy, borderline indestructible, can absorb and redirect energy, and can move extremely fast. 

September 15th
	He began tracking [[The Party]]. 

**Agenda**
- Avenge what he lost before he dies.
- Ruin the lives of [[The Party]]
- Kill [[The Party]] (Or their families)
- Ruin [[House Galling]]
- Kill [[Bradford]]
- Die

**Appearance**
- A man in a long dark-red trench coat and a wide cowboy hat and a bandana. He has glowing red eyes. He has a smooth metal arm. 
- He's standing far away in the center of a town
- D&D 5e full body colored sketch artwork
