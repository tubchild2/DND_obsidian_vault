### 10000
> Pluto Winton Haywood was born in a small, lower-class village on Pluto (the planet). Though dirt poor, he aspired to become the greatest adventurer who ever lived. He wanted to be a space-pirate, a treasure hunter, and filthy rich. It's customary for males to take the planet's name and go by their middle name, but Pluto wanted a name that was simultaneously iconic and inconspicuous. That's why he decided to go by Pluto after leaving home. He still follows Plutonian customs, like paying his respects to the great moons, celebrating Plutonian new years (once every ~248 Earth years) (he did once), yearly ice sculpting, and habitually keeping candles and fires burning through the night due to Plutonian winters being infamously cold and dark.

### 10024
> Pluto is contacted by Emily Galling (the current [[House Galling|patriarch]]'s wife) ([[Bradford]]) with inside information about [[House Galling]], [[Manor Galling]], their plans, and that they had spent 404 billion [[Galactic Standards|credits]], and 98% of the [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] on a pointless statue named [[Mano di Dio]]! It had some silly religious explanation for existence, but Pluto knew it didn't matter. He gathered his men together, and executed the heist on [[Manor Galling]]. During the heist however, Pluto uncovered a secret basement door that wasn't in the plans. Curious, he looked around, and discovered the [[Armstrong Initiative]], as well as the barely conscious [[Tessali]] being tortured. It then finally clicked why Emily would want her own empire to fall. Enraged at the situation, he derailed the plan to try and free the [[Tessali]], and burn the [[Armstrong Initiative]] (and [[Manor Galling]]) to the ground. He snuck around the manor and learned everything. His men turned on him to try and get the statue out, but the uncontrollable fire quickly turned things into a firefight between them and security. Pluto escaped with the [[Tessali]], and [[Mano di Dio]], leaving his men behind to die. Pluto then retreats to his home on mars, only to find his family and friends executed. With nothing and no one, Pluto retreats into [[The Deadwoods]], and begins living off the grid in a small cabin he built ([[Pluto's Cottage]]). Knowing what he knows, he decided to try to destroy as much [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] as he could. The [[Tessali]] (being the source of [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]]) needed to be kept out of human hands. Thankfully, once it recovers, this shouldn't be a problem, as it's main function is to do that. [[Mano di Dio|The Mano Di Dio]] on the other hand, needed to go. 

### 10024 - 10063
> Pluto spent forty years attempting to destroy the statue to no avail. Realizing he couldn't do it, he had an epiphany. He didn't have the technology to destroy it, but if he gave it to someone else in the future, they might be able to do just that. 
> Around this time he started noticing a man in a suit observing him. He didn't know what he was. ([[The Uncatchable Man|The man in the fog]]).
> He set up a trial in the most inhospitable, awful, god forsaken location he could find: the caverns of [[Wyrm's Rest]], right below the ruins of the old [[Armstrong Initiative]]. There, he warns travelers of the danger of the task, and he refuses to explain what it is or why [[House Galling]] wants it.
