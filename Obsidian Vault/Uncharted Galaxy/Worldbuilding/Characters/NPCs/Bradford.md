### Lore and Roleplay
**Personality**
- **Desensitized and Bored.** He's so old that most mortal affairs barely register as background noise to him. He's done pretty much everything by this point, and is indifferent to everything but [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] and the [[Mano di Dio]]. He longs for joy and change. He sees [[Primordial of Order|Tod]]'s new world order as means to be happy again. 
- **Refined.** Everything he does has a purpose. He's purposeful, methodical, and elegant.
- **Superior and Rude.** Sees himself above everyone else due to his immortality and experience. He has no qualms hurting people for [[Primordial of Order|Tod]], since they lack his cosmic significance. He doesn't protect anyone's feelings.
- **True Fearlessness.** He has no anxiety, or fear, and he doesn't react to discomfort anymore. He'll do things that no one else would even dare to do. He'll hold conversations mid-battle, grab red hot metal, let himself get hit, jump off buildings, drown himself, drink poisons, etc. He doesn't even flinch anymore because he knows he'll recover instantly.
- **Reasonable.** He doesn't want to argue or fight. He'll cut people deals, and be generally reasonable. 
- **Devout.** One thing that's stuck with him is the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]]. He hates the [[Illeth]], has extreme convictions about right and wrong, and will not hesitate to punish people he sees as beneath him. 

**Backstory**
10000
	Born in [[Manor Galling]] as the rightful heir to [[House Galling]]. Quickly taught the teachings of the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]]. He was rude, selfish, and arrogant from a young age. He was extremely devout to the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]], and therefore very racist towards the [[Illeth]]. 

10018
	Simeon Galling (his father) died of old age, and he took up the mantle of [[House Galling|Patriarch]]. He wasn't liked by the public, and was frequently harassed due to being a rich kid, an inexperienced leader, and the representative of [[House Galling]] and the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]], which both have an awful reputation. 
	He needed to marry someone and have kids per his responsibility as [[House Galling|Patriarch]], so he married Emily Peterson, someone he knew when he was a kid. Emily did not like Bradford, he was abusive, vindictive, and manipulative. 
	Bradford approved of the [[Armstrong Initiative]]'s experimentation on the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|scorned]]. He believed they deserved it.

10020
- Late one night, [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] appeared outside of Bradford's bedroom door. The two had a private conversation. [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] told Bradford he was an angel, and that he needed Bradford's help. Bradford was skeptical at first, but [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] demonstrated his power and Bradford apologized profusely. 
- [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] said that he needed to bring about a new age for [[The Galaxy]], one where everyone would be absolutely equal. There would be no work, no stress, no hunger, no thirst. In his world, people would be truly free. He just needed more "angels." All Bradford would need to do is build another, bigger [[Gateways|gateway]], and he'd be greatly rewarded. Bradford agreed, and Bradford was officially a servant of [[Primordial of Order|Tod]]. 
- Bradford immediately made plans with the [[Armstrong Initiative]], and the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] to commission a large [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] statue to open a larger [[Gateways|gateway]]. They agreed, and he spent nearly all of their [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] on building the statue, which was later named the [[Mano di Dio]]. In exchange, [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] made Bradford an [[Ether Users|Ether User]]. 

10024
- Emily discovered the [[Armstrong Initiative]], and was disgusted. They were torturing *children* in the name of science, and executing people on the basis that they were sinners! It was horrific!
- Emily worked with the [[Heretics]], and set up a plan. She convinced Bradford to do a public display of the [[Mano di Dio]] for PR, giving [[Pluto]] an opportunity to steal it. She gave him insider information about the guard rotations, maps of the manor, where the [[Mano di Dio]] would be, all of the specifications about the defense systems, and more. She made it very clear that he should steal it, and showed him everything him and his crew needed to know.
- During the heist, [[Pluto]] found the [[Tessali]], and the [[Armstrong Initiative]].  Enraged, he burned [[Manor Galling]] down. The heist devolved into a shootout, and [[Pluto]] made it out with the [[Tessali]] and [[Mano di Dio]] (something they can't replicate without the [[Tessali]]) despite knowing nothing about their true nature. Emily was shot during the conflict.
- Enraged, [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] had Bradford execute everyone present (including his own men) to prevent word of the [[Armstrong Initiative]] from getting out. [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] then ordered Bradford to pursue [[Pluto]]. They found nothing, so [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] used Bradford to kill [[Pluto]]'s friends and family. He then relentlessly pursued [[Pluto]] with an army of bounty hunters, and the full military might of [[House Galling]]. 

12024
	Bradford has spent 2000 years combing [[The Galaxy]] for the [[Tessali]] and [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]], all for [[Primordial of Order|Tod]]. He's done many unspeakable acts in his name, and it's been an agonizing, slow, tedious crawl. He's even more reclusive, and is neither respected nor hated. He relies heavily on other people to make decisions, and only really cares about finding the [[Mano di Dio]]. 

**Agenda**
1. Earn something real for himself that no one can deny he deserved
2. Worship at the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]]. 
3. Find the [[Mano di Dio]] for [[Primordial of Order|Tod]].

**Appearance**
- Tall, gaunt body
- Looks like he's in his mid-30s
- Unpleasant facial features
- Wears a regal black robe
- Wears black combat boots
- Wears black leather gloves
