### Description
As you walk into the keep, an unnatural darkness swallows you whole. Tall opulent yet decaying stone tunnels stretch out in front of you.

### Room Descriptions
![[F1 Carrion Keep_83x47.png]]
**Floor 1**
***Chasm Chamber***
You step into a cavernous chamber riddled with stone ruins. The entire floor of the chamber has crumbled and fallen into a vast system of caverns that you can't see the bottom of. You're standing on a ruined stone balcony still holding to the walls of the cavern. 

(North entrance)
A movable bridge sits 60ft below the balcony, hanging from rusted chains. When raised, it would have allowed you to meet the perpendicular bridge and towers on the other side of the cave. 

(West entrance)
A set of thin wooden bridges extend in front of you, connecting to a damaged stone tower in the center. All the way at the other end, is a large metallic door protecting entrance to a room with large mechanical pulleys and gears built into it. 
There's a small movable bridge 60ft or so below your feet, extending left out of the middle stone tower. It's hanging by rusted chains. When raised, it'd lead directly to the exit. 

[[Exotic Metals|Illidium]] Door
The door has a 3x3 pad of switches. Above the pad, a phrase is engraved in [[Illish]].
	(If translated) it reads "The First [[Illeth]] City." Each of the switches are engraved with a different word. Those words are:
		1. Grey
		2. Great
		3. Carrion
		4. Mire
		5. Keep
		6. Well
		7. Beholder
		8. Pass
		9. City
The correct combination is 3 and 6, or "[[Carrion Well]]."

***Control room***
Behind the [[Exotic Metals|Illidium]] door is a room with a large metal wheel that can be turned to raise the movable bridge. 

***Grand Hall***
You enter a large stone brick chamber. Large stone arches hold up the cavernous ceiling, while small burnt rats scurry around the floor, weaving through the tall malformed skeletons piled around the corners.

There's the entrance to the south, a hallway to the east, a hallway to the north, and two doors to the west. There's also a balcony from the second story running around the left, front, and right sides of the room. 

***Dining Hall***
A room with an ornately carved wood table taking up majority of the floor space. It's covered with dust, candles, plates, and silverware. There's a door to the kitchen on the west end. 

***Kitchen***
A series of cabinets and countertops riddled with dust and cobwebs. There's a door on the south that leads to the pantry.

***Pantry***
A gothic stone room with filled with dark wooden barrels.

***North Hall Split* (North of the Grand Hall)**
There are 3 new doors, 2 lead to staircases, and one leads to a library.

***Library***
This room is notably taller than the previous few, with bookshelves extending up a story to be accessed via balcony. There's a ladder in the corner to climb up. 

Perception check for the books:
- Book on the [[Illeth]] empire (read the prehistory section)
- Book on [[Illeth]] biology (read race description)
- Book on the [[Fernites|Fernite]] infestation (read the 7082 section)
- Book on the arrival of humans (read the 7105-7107 section)
Perception check for the hidden door:
- The bookcase in the northern corner is pulled out further than the rest.
- Checking behind it reveals a small diamond shaped hole that leads to a hidden room.

***Hidden Library***
Crawling through the hole, you find yourself in a room with a stone throne, a bookcase covered in cobwebs, and a table with an open book. Some random items are scattered around the room.

Checking the book:
	It's a scribe's open log book detailing "recent" events. (read the scribe's writing in the 7171 section) ([[Illeth]])
Checking the random items:
	There are 3 dusty silver chalices (50c), some old maps of [[Vivimus]] (12c), a small busted music box (5c), and the log book (200c).

**Floor 2**
*Balcony*
	Coming up out of the stairs, you find yourselves on a balcony looking down at the grand hall. There are two doors on the left wall that lead to staircases, a door on the north wall that leads to a bathhouse, and a door on the east wall that leads to another hallway. 
*Archery Point A*
	Stepping outside, you find yourself above the gates overlooking [[Archer's Pass]]. There's a door that leads into the mountain, and one that leads into a much larger, more ornate tower with large smashed-in tinted windows.
	This balcony was likely used for archers to fire down onto [[Archer's Pass]]. 
*Bathhouse*
	You enter a large room with several moldy channels for storing water. There are black vines growing throughout the walls. 
*Map Room*
	You enter a large ornate tower. The tinted glass walls are smashed in, and the misty winds blow in from the window. In the center of the room sits a large circular table displaying a weathered and dogeared map of the immediate area. Large red X's mark the other [[Illeth]] cities and landmarks. 

![[F3 Carrion Keep_49x26.png]]
**Floor 3**
*Wall Roof*
	Stepping out onto the surface once more, you find yourself atop a massive wall used by the [[Illeth]] archers to defend [[Archer's Pass]]. 
	There are two doors, one at the far left, and one at the far right.
*Vault / King's Chamber*
	The door to this chamber was made from a solid metal, but it appears that it was melted through. Inside, you find a bunch of chests, as well as a smaller throne. 
		Perception Check please?
			There's a small key on the ground.

**Basement 1**
*Dungeon*
	You enter a cramped, poorly carved dungeon. There are 20 or so cells. Each cell has a skeleton in it.
*Guard's Quarters*
	You step into a lavish hand carved hallway. Each of the rooms is a room for a guard or other member of the keep's staff. They were torn apart and looted. There are thick, 5 finger claw marks on the doors. Some of the doors were smashed down.

### History
- Built atop the capital of the [[Illeth]] civilization--[[Carrion Well]].
- After their defeat at [[Archer's Pass]], the city was left completely undefended, and the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] enslaved the entire [[Illeth]] race for work in the Great Mines.
