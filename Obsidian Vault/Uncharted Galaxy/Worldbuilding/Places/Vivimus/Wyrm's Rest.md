![[The Bunker of Wyrm's rest.webp]]

### General Information
- Located on [[Vivimus]], in [[Beholder's Reach]]
- Contains a bunker operated by the [[Armstrong Initiative]] several thousand years ago. Was a prime location for horrific experimentation on kids to produce soldiers capable of rivalling the local alien empires. It also gave way to the creation of the [[Fernites]], which completely wiped out the planet. They mutated everything, bonded DNA across creatures, and completely upturned the biology of the planet ([[Vivimus]])

### Tips for the Session
1. **Fear of the Unknown.** Keep players in the dark about what is going on, and don't show the monster for awhile. Show the impacts of the monster, and build up questions about what they are, let suspense build, make it unclear what their motives are, etc. 
2. **Immersion.** Put a lot of effort into detail, and ambience.
3. **Disempowerment.** Make players feel outmatched, weak, and like they could actually die in here.
4. **Tension.** Use tense situations in combination with horror. Time limit, stealth, etc.
5. **Body Horror.** This the source of the [[Fernites]]. The humans that ran this bunker were completely infected and mutated into tall, nimble, and quiet humanoid monsters. 
6. **Monster.** Unknown motives, shouldn't be here, clearly more powerful than the players, uses body horror. Mimics PC voices (if they're separated). 
7. **Hallucinations.** Sometimes, a party member will spot something out of the corner of their eye that no one else sees. 

### Area Descriptions (Bunker)
[[Wyrm's Rest Flowchart.canvas|Wyrm's Rest Flowchart]]

**Exterior**
- After a day of hard travel through the harsh terrain of [[Vivimus]], the sight of flat, solid ground is almost a luxury. The jagged peaks shrink behind you, and for the first time in what feels like forever, the world opens up into something calm. The air is a comfortable temperature, and the only sound is the howling of the light wind. It's... peaceful.
- Ahead, you spot a clearing. The ground stretches wide, scattered with scrubby red plants and long abandoned fences that lean lazily into the dirt. A half buried sign pokes up from the ground. 
	- The sign is a pale red, and any text that was on it has completely faded. 
- In the center of the clearing, a square chasm yawns into the earth. A narrow dirt staircase spirals down along its edges, stable enough to look like it's stood the test of time. 

**Entrance and lobby**
- Building dread that something is wrong, without saying it. Hint at the issues. 
- Wyrm's rest leads to a laboratory. It seems to have been hand carved. At the base is a crumbling stone door that's been boarded up. It's been thoroughly sealed with faded hazard tape.
- The room is pitch black; the power has been turned off. Flicking on your [[Item Catalogue|flashlights]], you spot a few red fabric chairs and a receptionists' desk. The walls are paneled with a bolted purplish-blue metal, and a door hangs ajar of its hinges at the end of the room.

**Cavern Hatch**
- The entrance to the caverns of Wyrm's rest is protected by a 2ft thick steel door. The facility needs to run on at least 30% power to open the door. They can take Path 1, Path 2, Path 3, or Path 4, they all lead to 10% backup generators.  
- Encourage them to split into groups somehow, then physically separate the groups. 

**Path 1**
- Business Area
- The Door
	- At the end of the hallway, you find a 12 inch steel door. Could I get a perception check?
	- You know that feeling you get when you're home alone, and you see a door closed with the light on? Or when you get home after a long day and notice something moved. It's not a thought, it's more primal than that. It's an awareness. You can feel someone there, just out of sight. That's what you feel: a primal anxiety. With no evidence, no reason, no logic, you know there's someone on the other side. 
	- Entering the room: You're completely alone.

### Area Descriptions (Caverns)
**General Goal**
	Alien horror. There are organic structures that are alien, unknowable, and somehow the infrastructure of [[Vivimus]]' ecology. There are huge organic glowing structures that you can't measure or fully comprehend, unnatural terrain formations, and places that suggest intelligent design despite not having it. It's like exploring the guts of a giant creature. Faint organic sighs echo through the halls. Heartbeat esc pulses in the walls. Some corridors constrict when revisited.
