Appearance
- Single celled organisms made of a black, sticky genetic material. Their nucleus emits a soft bloody red glow.
- Their cells have thin nerve endings protruding from them, which directly connect to the nucleus. 
- The nerve endings will enter organic material, and expand due to building pressure. This gives them an extremely powerful grip.

Thermogeneticsynthesis in Fernites
- Thermogeneticsynthesis is an alternative to photosynthesis. Fernites suck in carbon dioxide, and the myophyll in their nucleus absorbs the heat. This then triggers a series of heat dependent reactions that split water and provide electrons to replace those lost by the myophyll. They can use this energy to divide, and replicate indefinitely. 
- Their nuclei act as temporary heat batteries in case of excess heat consumption. The vent in the nucleus acts as a vent to move air in and out. It does this by creating microscopic temperature imbalances to create movement. 
- Due to processing more air, they can collect water drops from the vapors in the air every day or two. 
- Heat builds pressure, and too much pressure within the nuclei causes it to pop. 

Life Cycle
- Spores. Typically 1-6 Fernites bound together via their nerve endings. They drift aimlessly.
- Symbiosis. Upon hitting organic material, they latch and bond. Compatible hosts will have excess co2, and be warm. They'll enter the organism and spread as quickly as possible. If two spores are competing for one host, the smaller one will concede and be absorbed by the larger one. 
- Networks. After firmly spreading throughout the host, they'll expand and form small vents in dead tissue to allow more air to enter. They'll begin building more heat within these vents than they can handle, leading to small explosions that shoot spores out. If the host has a nervous system, they'll likely begin to notice the ability to subtly influence the network, as if it were a muscle. 
- Maturity. Once they've completely overtaken the host, they stop growing. They'll replace dead Fernites, but they cannot grow outside the surface of the host. 

Mutation
- During symbiosis, the Fernites latch onto the cells of the host. Whenever spores are removed, they take some DNA with them. If these contaminated spores bind to something else, they cram that DNA into the cells of the new host. As they replicate, this mutation does as well. 
- These mutations compound with every new host added. After 2 or 3 mutations, you can no longer identify the original hosts. 

Measurements and Taxonomy
- A single Fernite has a volume of roughly 5e-18 m^3, a mass of 4e-13 grams, and in perfect conditions, roughly 5e-5 joules of excess energy within their nuclei. A single Fernite prefers exactly 95 degrees for optimal growth, anymore and they’ll take in unnecessary heat, leading to potential overindulgence and detonation. The larger the network, the higher the temperature they prefer, typically increasing by 7.5e-19 degrees Fahrenheit per Fernite.
- They fall under the protist kingdom. While they do link together to form communal organisms, they don’t completely combine, making them technically single celled organisms. Due to them having elements from plants, animals, and due to being thermosynthagenic, they make up an entirely new phylum called “Caloriphyta”. From there, there are no classes, orders, families, or genera to organize them into. They are the only occupant of the Caloriphyta phylum.

Being cured
- The only way to kill the Fernites is to heat the host to 150 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours. This burns the host, and could potentially kill them. The popping Fernites could be potentially deadly, and lead to severe internal bleeding. It also fills the blood and body with gunk that must be removed surgically. The sooner after infection that you start this process, the more effective it will be. 

History
- The [[Federation]] moved onto the volcanic planet of [[Vivimus]] in 7082. They were tasked to experiment with bioweapons in a secured bunker in a large cave system. 
- During testing, a scientist named Mikhail Volkov created the Fernite, a creature designed to be as adaptable and viral as possible. It spread to him, and to the other scientists within minutes. The mutations followed soon after, as the creatures nearby were given part human DNA. 
- The Fernites rapidly spread through the cave systems, and emerged onto the surface via geysers and eruptions within days. Once the [[Federation]] was informed, it was far too late. The virus was spreading far faster and more aggressively than they could contain. It quickly overtook the planet, so the initiative destroyed all evidence of their involvement. 
- The Fernites rapidly made their way deeper into the planet, growing structures that would spectacularly detonate and upheave entire valleys with no warning.
