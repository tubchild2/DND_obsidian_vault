### History
1. Created by [[Bradford]] from 10020-10024. It was designed to open a sustainable portal to [[Caldwell's Field]], and to efficiently distribute its heat. [[Bradford]] thought it was a means to cause the Rapture, the [[Armstrong Initiative]] saw it as a way to create an infinite power source, and the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] saw it as a means to please God. It's name translates to "The Hand of God"
2. Immediately after being completed, it was stolen from its exhibition by [[Pluto]]. Not understanding its purpose, he held on to it. He could never sell it, so he was kind of stuck guarding it and the [[Tessali]]. It's been at the end of his hunt ever since.
