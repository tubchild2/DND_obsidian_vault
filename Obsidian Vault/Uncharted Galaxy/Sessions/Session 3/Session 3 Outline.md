Pre game
- Ensure everyone has their background, subclass, feat, and health fixed
- Health is calculated by rolling the hit die of your class a number of times equal to your level in it, then adding your constitution modifier multiplied by your level to the previous total. This gives you your new maximum hp.

- Read out [[Wyrm's Rest]] Mechanics

Pre game monologue:
- **LOWER EXPECTATIONS.** This session is going to be much more chill than the last few. But just as a reminder, if you die, you cannot be brought back by any means. Just... value your lives, because once your character dies you can't get them back. Not that you will be at any risk though, because once again this session is going to mostly safe. 
- **SET UP CONFUSION.** Another standard reminder, if you want to do something in universe, whatever it is, I'll let you do it. You're guiding the story, not me. If you want to go somewhere, you can. 

Content:
- Exploring [[Wyrm's Rest]]. 
- By the time they get back, [[Dale Borland]] will be alive and active. If they go back to the casino it'll be full of bodies. They'll be bashed and bruised and torn up. 
- They're also wanted by [[House Galling]] for multiple counts of murder, theft, possession of illegal substances, and a whole lot of other things. They one they're really stressing is that they went on the surface without a permit. That's what they think is the most important.
