Pre game
- Ensure everyone has their background, subclass, feat, and health fixed
- Health is calculated by rolling the hit die of your class a number of times equal to your level in it, then adding your constitution modifier multiplied by your level to the previous total. This gives you your new maximum hp.

Pre game monologue:
- **LOWER EXPECTATIONS.** This session is going to be much more chill than the last few. But just as a reminder, if you die, you cannot be brought back by any means. Just... value your lives, because once your character dies you can't get them back. Not that you will be at any risk though, because once again this session is going to mostly safe. But after last session I felt like reminding you guys, there will be some fights you simply cannot win. 
- **SET UP CONFUSION.** Another standard reminder, if you want to do something in universe, whatever it is, I'll let you do it. You're guiding the story, not me. If you want to go somewhere, you can. 

Content:
- Exploring [[Wyrm's Rest]]. 
- They're also wanted by [[House Galling]] for multiple counts of murder, theft, possession of illegal substances, and a whole lot of other things. They one they're really stressing is that they went on the surface without a permit. That's what they think is the most important. 

### [[Dale Borland]] Arc:
Phase 1: Dread
- Room full of criminal bodies. "A life for a life."
- He has a reputation. "The stories are unreliable. Multiple reports over the past few days saw people entering their homes, their businesses, their schools, to find corpses. The corpses weren't killed quickly, they were beaten and snapped--slowly--intimately. I don't know if the stories are even related, but if they are, it's killed hundreds of people in the last few nights alone"
- "A life for a life" is graffitied onto a place they frequented.

Phase 2: Pursuit
- Dale's ship lands around the same time theirs does.
- Dale's figure can be seen in the far distance watching them. 
- Dale snipes someone they're working with (if they're a murderer)
- They can find Dale's ship.
