Pre game
- Ensure everyone has their background, subclass, feat, and health fixed

Pre game monologue:
- **LOWER EXPECTATIONS.** This session is going to be much more chill than the last few. But just as a reminder, if you die, you cannot be brought back by any means. Just... value your lives, because once your character dies you can't get them back. Not that you will be at any risk though, because once again this session is going to mostly safe. 
- **SET UP CONFUSION.** Another standard reminder, if you want to do something in universe, whatever it is, I'll let you do it. You're guiding the story, not me. If you want to go somewhere, you can.

Dale Borland Mini Arc:

3. On his ship, they can find equipment for making weapons, as well as a tape player with a collection of tapes. They can choose to play them and it'll play a song from his playlist on Spotify.
4. Once they're isolated, Dale will trap and ambush them.
