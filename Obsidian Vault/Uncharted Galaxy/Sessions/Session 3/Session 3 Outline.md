Pre game
- Ensure everyone has their background, subclass, feat, and health fixed
- Health is calculated by rolling the hit die of your class a number of times equal to your level in it, then adding your constitution modifier multiplied by your level to the previous total. This gives you your new maximum hp. 
- Read out Mikhail's Behavior
- Read out [[Wyrm's Rest]] Mechanics

Pre game monologue:
- **LOWER EXPECTATIONS.** This session is going to be much more chill than the last few. But just as a reminder, if you die, you cannot be brought back by any means. Just... value your lives, because once your character dies you can't get them back. Not that you will be at any risk though, because once again this session is going to mostly safe. But after last session I felt like reminding you guys, there will be some fights you simply cannot win. 
- **SET UP CONFUSION.** Another standard reminder, if you want to do something in universe, whatever it is, I'll let you do it. You're guiding the story, not me. If you want to go somewhere, you can. 
- **RECAP.** Choose 5 people. Each person recaps a session.
	- Session 0: The Cabin
	- Session 1: The City (make sure to mention Dale!)
	- Session 1.1: Xavi's Heist One Shot
	- Session 1.2: Xavi's Slavery One Shot
	- Session 2: The Wilderness of [[Vivimus]]

Content:
- Exploring [[Wyrm's Rest]]. 
- They're also wanted by [[House Galling]] for multiple counts of murder, theft, possession of illegal substances, and a whole lot of other things. They one they're really stressing is that they went on the surface without a permit. That's what they think is the most important. 

### [[Dale Borland]] Arc:
Phase 1: Dread
- It's pouring rain. 
- Room full of criminal bodies. "A life for a life."
- He has a reputation. "The stories are unreliable. Multiple reports over the past few days saw people entering their homes, their businesses, their schools, to find corpses. The corpses weren't killed quickly, they were beaten and snapped--slowly--intimately. I don't know if the stories are even related, but if they are, it's killed hundreds of people in the last few nights alone"
- "A life for a life" is graffitied onto a place they frequented.

Phase 2: Pursuit
- Dale's ship lands around the same time theirs does.
- Dale's figure can be seen in the far distance watching them. 
- They can find Dale's ship.

	- Letter addressed to reed. "There was so much I wanted to tell you, so much I wanted to do, so much life I wanted to live. I love you Reed. I hope you're in a better place, and I hope you aren't watching me now."
	- Tables covered in firearm parts and forging equipment.
	- A bulky phone that was ripped out of the wall and smashed on the counter.
	- There's a queen sized bed. One half is very neat, and the other is a mess of stains and pulled up blankets.

Phase 3: Confrontation
- Dale snipes someone they're working with (if they're a murderer)
- Dale attempts to snipe Gemini and Taure. 
	- (If they see him) 
		- Heâ€™s dressed in a cold, weathered brown leather outfit, stained with dirt and blood, and draped in a tattered red cloak that flaps against the wind like a banner of death. His face is hidden beneath a brass skull-like mask, the hollow eyes glowing with a small, beady red light that seems to burn through the haze. His wide-brimmed hat further obscured his gaze.
		- He's crouched on the rooftop, studying you in absolutely still silence. He exudes an aura of absolute malice. He's waiting for you to make a move. 
- Dale begins chasing them. 
	- HE DOESNT SAY A WORD
	- He punches through doors, he hucks heavy objects, he slaughters animals or weaker enemies, and leaps great distances. Make it clear that this guy can and will kill them. 
- The fight isn't about beating him, it's about escaping him. HE DOESNT SAY A WORD
	- Loss Condition: If Gemini and Taure die. He'll beat and snap their corpses, and then calmly walk off. 
	- Stalling Condition: You hear like pattering on the rooftops and alleyways, and suddenly a group of 5 or 6 [[CSG and HG Soldiers|inquisitors]] pounce [[Dale Borland|the Arbiter]]. He punches one and snaps its neck, but the others are attempting to restrain him. You're ambushed by a group of [[CSG and HG Soldiers|inquisitors]] as well. 
	- Win Condition: If he gets low enough, he'll vanish, and plan a new course accordingly.
