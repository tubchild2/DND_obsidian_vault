- Separate lore from plot for [[Vivere Mori]]. (session 1.2)
- [[Bradford]] v5. Give him some dang abilities! How about, he's not that crazy physically, but he can mind control people and manifest [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnaves]]. 
- Make statblocks for
	- [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Enforcers]]
	- [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Inquisitors]]

			- A crazy freaking arsenal, including [[Weapon Catalogue|the warknuckle]]
			- Enhanced speed
			- Enhanced strength x3
			- Enhanced intelligence
			- Enhanced defense
			- Enhanced health
			- A set of [[Caldwell's Field|Ether]] abilities that boost all previously mentioned abilities

- The Empires. 
	- Each galactic plate is controlled by a different empire. The [[Federation]] / [[House Galling]] are in the same one. 
	- Galactic conflicts are constant, and tensions are always high.
	- Leaving your plate is a no-go unless you've got a REAL good reason to. 
- [[Federation]]
	- Who, or what is the emperor?
	- What do they do?
	- Why did the [[Federation]] form?
	- Where do they operate?
	- What are their laws?
	- What conflicts have they been a part of?
- [[Aalim Denzel]] needs more of a role. 
- Add the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnave]] and other [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] and [[House Galling]] soldiers' armors, weapons, and items to the [[armor catalogue]], [[weapon catalogue]], and [[item catalogue]]. 
	- Don't forget to add their aliases. 
- Make [[Illidium]] variants of various weapons and armors. It's worth double.
