### Session 2 Planning
- Changes. 
	- The [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] teachings need to be more specified. Where did they come from? How do they change Christianity? Who was their founder? 
	- [[Pluto]] never directly communicates to [[the party]]. He gives vague clues and trinkets to tell people where to go next, and relies heavily on other means of communication. He's playing his cards close to his chest. Make it a hunt, not a railroad. 
	- The Empires of [[the Galaxy]] need to be defined. [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] is manipulating people in all of them. Each Galactic plate has its own Empire. 
	- The reveal of [[Primordial of Order|Tod]]'s deal with [[Bradford]] happens towards the end in a Uncharted-bunker-esc section. 
- Detail out all of the structures they could go to as session sections. Be careful to separate session information and location information. 
	- [[Mistriven]]
		- Descriptions
		- Battle map of the center of the village, or the mountains, or the docks. 
	- [[Fennhollow Pass]]
		- Description
			- [[Illeth]] lore
			- Fun loot and stuff
			- Maybe a puzzle that sets up later ones?
		- Battle map of about halfway through the climb
	- [[Beholder's Reach|Chimera Crags]]
		- Descriptions
		- Camping.
	- [[Session 2.4-Wyrm's Rest]]
		- Descriptions
			- [[Beholder's Reach|Mutant hive]] horror lab or stone dungeon and caverns
			- Darkness mechanics
			- Puzzles
			- Setup for the hunt
			- Fun loot
- Add ambience to all of them

	- Where do they operate?
	- What are their laws?

- Make [[Illidium]] variants of various weapons and armors. It's worth double.
