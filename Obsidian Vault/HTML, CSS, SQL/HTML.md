## HTML is for structure
- Starts with indication of document type, followed by a head part and page title, and then the body
	- Typically, this looks like the following (ignore the apostrophes):
		- <'!DOCTYPE html>
		- <'html lang = "en"> (encloses everything else)
		- <'head>
			- <'meta charset="UTF-8"> (this should be included)
			- <'title>INSERT TITLE HERE<'/title>
		- <'/head> 
			- Contains document title, metadata, and other things that aren't displayed in the webpage
		- <'body>
		- <'/body>
		- You can additionally divide up html code with sections with <'section> <'/section>
- Elements are represented by tags
	- h1, h2, and h3 are headers
	- p is for paragraphs
		- You can give them the id="" attribute so that links can put # whatever_was_in_the_quotes to link to that specific section.
	- em or i or cite is for italic 
	- strong or b is for bold
	- img is for images
		- <'img src="INSERT FILE LOCATION HERE" alt="INSERT ALT ATTRIBUTE HERE> (doesn't require closing tag)
		- You can put other attributes 
			- height=""
			- width=""
	- a is for links (for some reason)
		- <'a href = "INSERT LINK HERE"> INSERT HYPERLINK TEXT HERE<'/a>
	- br is for the background I assume? Doesn't need a closing tag
	- <'html lang = "INSERT LANGUAGE (probably just EN) HERE"> encloses everything 
	- <'meta> is for metadata
	- <'br> inserts a line break into a paragraph
	- <'mark> highlights something
	- <'u> is for underlining
	- <'!-- is for tags -->
	- LISTS (you can nest these, but you've got to do it in a weird way where you basically need to leave a list element opened until the nested list is done.)
		- <'ul><'ul> creates an unordered list (bullet points) where each element is seperated with the tag <'li><'/li>
		- <'ol type =""><'/ol> is used to create ordered lists of a few types depending on what you put in those quotation marks. 1 will create a numbered list, A and capital alphabetical list, I a roman numeric list, and so on.
	- TABLES
		- started with <'table> and ended with <'/table>
		- captioned with <'caption><'/caption>
		- Rows are made with <'tr>and<'/tr>
		- Within the rows, cells are made with the <'th> and <'/th> tags for row headers, and normal table data for subsequent rows is entered with the <'td> and <'/td> tags
			- You can add some stuff to change how many columns and how many rows these cells take up
			- <'td rowspan = "3"><'/td>
			- <'th colspan = "3"><'/th>
	- LINKS
		- Types of URLs
			- file. For referring to a file on the web browser's computer
			- ftp. File transfer protocol. Downloading files.
			- Http. http requests without encryption
			- Https. Encrypted http requests and responses
			- mailto. Sending emails.
		- Relative URLS
			- To access files in the same directory
			- If it's in the same folder, just put the name of the file
			- If it's a layer down, put FOLDER_ITS_IN/FILE with the /
			- If it's a layer up, put ../ to move up a directory.
		- target attribute
			- target="'(UNDERSCORE)self" opens the link and erases the current tab
			- target="(UNDERSCORE)blank" opens the link in a new tab
	- Special characters can be written by entering weird and specific things:
		- Three ways
			- &name;
			- &number;
			- &hex;

- Tags are defined with <> and <'/> (ignore the apostrophe) to represent where the element begins and where it ends
