- They're (likely) going to go for the coordinates
	- Draw inspiration from Avatar, Nausicaa, and Metroid. 
	- Alien landscapes
	- Man vs. Nature
- Continue setting up Uncharted in space
	- Cool locations
	- Antagonistic force
	- Personal stakes
	- Interesting premise
	- All that jazz
	- Character growth
- Maybe after the coordinates, [[Vivere Mori]] could get nuked some how in the future? They could explore fresh city ruins. Draw inspiration from chapter 5 of super meat boy, and chapter 1 of celeste. 
- Maybe there could be a superintelligence as a villain
- Quantum locked creature
- Maybe there could be a guy who every time he dies, his dead body goes somewhere, and he gets cloned and his conscience transferred. Then, his dead bodies combine and form a monster that attacks [[the party]] and him.

- Hue Mann. Some kind of animal who's pretending to be human who has a butler interpreter (excellent suggestion lord)
