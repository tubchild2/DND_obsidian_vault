### Grand Scheme Preparations 
**PC Arcs**
- Weave their arcs into the overarching story as it progresses. These arcs establish and play with their wants and needs, and establishes their personal stakes for the rest of the plot.
- Research whether a single session issue or an arc would work better for this. 
**ETC Arcs**
- Work with the worldbuilding a little more. There's a lot you can do with rebellions, the rightful heir to [[House Galling]], the enslaved race in [[Vivere Mori]], the [[Federation]], the [[Primordial|primordials]], and more. 

### Session 2 Planning
- Instead of giving them one plot hook and destination, create 2 or 3 that they can choose from.

### Session 2 Physical Work
- Make a refined copy of Bjorn's backstory sheet.
- Redo physical inventories. They should match items in the PC's digital inventories.
- Redo item cards. They should not have designs, as they're exchangeable. They should match items in the PC's digital inventories. Copy information off the catalogues. 
- Design ability cards for Bjorn
- Reprint all minis on fine, and securely store them. 
- Make a page of DM Reminders so that you don't goof up.
- Restock on tape, folders, index cards
