- [ ] Miniatures 
	- [ ] Enemies
- [ ] Fix the [[brainstorm]] document
- [ ] Get last names

#### **30th To Do List**
- [ ] Copy obsidian vault over to laptop
- [ ] Pack (double check this to make sure you don't miss anything)
	- [ ] Miniatures
	- [ ] Laptop
- [ ] Disinfect everything before taking it over

#### **Next Time**
- [ ] World build
	- [ ] Make some alien races, and maybe an alien race catalogue (don't forget their planets)
		- [ ] Doppelgangers have to be in here somewhere
		- [ ] It'd be funny if Time Lords were implied to be cannon, but it's never explored.
	- [ ] The center of media in the world is Universal Pictures. Every day, the giant letters spin around the planet and make the fanfare, which both sounds and looks crazy from the surface.

- They're (likely) going to go for the coordinates
	- Draw inspiration from Avatar, Nausicaa, and Metroid. 
	- Alien landscapes
	- Man vs. Nature
- Maybe after the coordinates, [[Vivere Mori]] could get nuked some how in the future? They could explore fresh city ruins. Draw inspiration from chapter 5 of super meat boy, and chapter 1 of celeste. 
- Maybe there could be a superintelligence as a villain
- Quantum locked creature
- Maybe there could be a guy who every time he dies, his dead body goes somewhere, and he gets cloned and his conscience transferred. Then, his dead bodies combine and form a monster that attacks [[the party]] and him.
