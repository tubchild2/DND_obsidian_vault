### Features and Traits

---
### Lore
Flaws
- Uneducated. Can't read, write, do math, and is dyslexic.
- Insecure. Views everyone else as literally superior.
- Acts entirely off of improvisation because he's bad at making and following plans.
- Loser. People find him annoying and a hassle. He's been:
	- Excluded
	- Mocked
	- Avoided
	- Lied about 
	- Lied to
	- Dumped
	- Rejected
	- Heartbroken
	- Tricked
	- Pranked
	- Bullied
	- Beaten
	- Betrayed
	- Talked down to
	- Severely publicly humiliated
	- Yelled at
	- Unjustly punished, fired, arrested
	- Deeply disappointed in himself to the point of accepting he won't amount to anything.

Traits
- Loving. Refuses to let anything bad happen to anyone else.
- Optimistic and Trusting. Takes everything at face value, and always assumes the best.
- Fun. He isn't intimidating, and is funny (intentionally or not).
- Is currently learning to play the guitar. He's not fantastic, but he's very determined to get better.

Backstory
- Was born with a mental disability.
- Was bullied relentlessly and had a terrible school experience.
- His life has been one disappointment after another.
- His cousin Carter went missing exploring a mountain that emerged after an earthquake.
- It's been awhile since they last spoke. They were pretty close when they were younger, so this disappearance hit him pretty hard.
- He's been living off of pudding, ramen, and lake water for the past few months. He lives in a studio apartment that's comically small and dysfunctional. He's kept it as clean as he could, but it's naturally just gross.
- He's broke and working as a bartender, where he's regularly harassed by drunk customers. He's "friends" with the other employees, but they don't like him at all and regularly bully him.

Goal and Why
- Help people. He views others as superior, so helping others feels natural.
- Wants popularity. He really just needs a friend / self-esteem, but he doesn't know that.
- Aspires to be like Charlie Goode, the guitarist from The Goodmen. The rockstar lifestyle would be his actual worst nightmare, but he lacks the experience and practical wisdom to realize that. He just thinks he wants it because of the popularity and confidence that comes with it.

Inspirations
- Charlie Reynolds (stupidity, humor)
- Clark Kent (morality)
- Matt from the "JOE SCHMO SHOW" (exploited innocence)
- Steve Harrington (fall from grace, redemption, endurance)
- Johnny B. Goode (unintelligent but good at guitar)
- Ignacio from Nacho Libre (underdog)
