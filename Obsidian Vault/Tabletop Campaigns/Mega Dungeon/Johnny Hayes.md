Backstory
- Was born with a mental disability that runs in his family.
- Was bullied relentlessly and had a terrible school experience.
- His life has been one disappointment after another.
- His cousin Carter went missing exploring a mountain that emerged after an earthquake.
- It's been awhile since they last spoke. They were pretty close when they were younger, so this disappearance hit him pretty hard.
- He's been living off of pudding, ramen, and lake water for the past few months. He lives in a studio apartment that's comically small and dysfunctional. He's kept it as clean as he could, but it's naturally just gross.
- He's broke and working as a bartender, where he's regularly harassed by drunk customers. He's "friends" with the other employees, but they don't like him at all and regularly bully him.

Goal and Why
- Help people. He views others as superior, so helping others feels natural.
- Wants popularity. He really just needs a friend / self-esteem, but he doesn't know that.
- Thinks being a really good guitarist will make him popular.
