### Origins
U0-0 began creation by creating U1-1. It was protected as an isolated entity. Decisions in U1-1 create alternate dimensions that aren't protected.

Then, U0-0 created U2-2, and the Primordials. They sought freedom to grow in size and power, but were trapped, as the only world with intelligent life was inaccessible. 

Then, in the Garden of Eden, following the creation of man, the first decision was made. This created U1-3, the first unprotected plane. 

U1-3 was swiftly consumed by the Primordials. Each one fought to perpetuate their core concept and to blot out all others. This war was so impossibly intense that the entire universe was destroyed and rebuilt every 2 units of plank time. This was later known as the Great Primordial Scourge. 

This conflict birthed millions of new worlds, and billions of new Primordials. The war slowly fizzled out as the Primordials dispersed into their own realms, still as intent on enforcing their will as ever. The warfare is so slow now that it's almost imperceptible. 

However, every so often, two opposing Primordials set their sights on the same plane, leading to Lesser Primordial Scourges. This has happened millions of times, but mostly among these Great Primordials:
- Creation and Destruction
- Order and Chaos
- Life and Death
- Good and Evil
- Light and Dark
- Peace and War
- Substance and Emptiness
- Hot and Cold

Each Great Primordial has a domain plane, and several lesser planes under its rule. Lesser Primordials typically reside in a plane lorded by a similar Great Primordial.

### Plane Designation
A plane designation code is as follows:
$$UT-I$$
U: Universal Standard for plane designation. Created by the Primordial of Order.

T: Type, an integer.
- Type 0: Governance. No time, space, matter, or energy. There is only one, and nothing is powerful enough to access it.
- Type 1: Physical. A plane akin to our universe. Space, time, matter, energy, etc. 
- Type 2: Conceptual. A plane with time and space, but no matter or energy. Instead, it's built up of representations of thoughts and ideas. Only one is known to exist.
- Type 3: Pocket. A small plane created and perpetuated by an incredibly powerful device / entity.
- Type 4: Debt. There are several of these throughout the multiverse. They essentially allow for the creation of matter and energy by creating an equal amount of negative matter and energy within their bounds. If the negative matter or energy is ever accessed or released, it'll destroy an equal amount of whatever it touches to tip the cosmic scales to balance.

I: Index, an integer. Typically 30 digits long (nonillion)

### Core Planes
U0-0 The Source
	Nothing is known about this plane. It can only be accessed by creatures native to it. Everything in the multiverse is in subjection to this plane. It is the core of the multiverse and everything else is rooted here.

U1-1 The Universe
	Our universe. Created first. The primary interest of U0-0, and is isolated from the others. No extraplanar entities or substances can enter. Even attempting to do so causes instant destruction.  

U2-2 The Primordial Deep
	Thoughts and ideas from across the multiverse form and flow within the Primordial Deep. They merge into sentient individual concepts called Primordials that serve to perpetuate the concept core to their existence. 
	There cannot be two Primordials with the same concepts. Primordials of too similar of concepts merge into one. 
	Primordials have authority over their concepts when in physical worlds. The extent of that control depends on how grand their core concepts are. The more life thinks about their concept, the more powerful they are. That's why broad, ancient concepts yield much more powerful Primordials.
	Primordials are capable of travelling to any plane via portals given their core concept exists on both sides of portal. They jump from sources of that concept. 
	Primordials are drawn to places with potential for their concept, or that are in direct opposition of their concept. When they arrive, they seek to correct and yield as fast as possible.

U1-3 The Root
	The first unprotected plane. It was the battleground of the Primordials. It is now an incredibly unpredictable world filled completely with random garbage and lesser Primordials.

U4-4 The Void
	The first and by far the largest debt dimension. Jam packed with antimatter and negative energy. Residence of the Primordial of Balance, and the Primordial of Darkness. Anything thrown into here is immediately disassembled and consumed by the unending darkness.
