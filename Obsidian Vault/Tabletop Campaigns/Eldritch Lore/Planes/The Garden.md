A universe wide garden teeming with life. The entire ecosystem is wonderfully complex and balanced. Residence of the Primordial of Life.

Deep within the Garden are the Caverns of Viscera, the domain of the Primordial of Flesh. 

The native creatures are the gardeners, tall floating creatures that tend to the ecosystem.
