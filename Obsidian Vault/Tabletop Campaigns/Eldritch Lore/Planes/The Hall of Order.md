A perfectly symmetrical and functional world. Everything behaves exactly as it should. The product of the Primordial of Order, the Primordial of Good, and the Primordial of Peace.

Two intelligent species live here: 
- The Sentinels. Tall perfectly symmetrical creatures capable of creating portals between two points in the multiverse to enforce order. Created by the Primordial of Order.
- The Good Ones. Small soft creatures without an aggressive bone in their bodies. They behave perfectly all the time.
