Hard Light is a form of superhot plasma that's shaped with incredibly tight magnetic fields. It's used in weapons for it's unmatchable efficiency, precision, and sharpness. The only downside of hard light weapons is that an entire half needs to be dedicated to the opposing magnetic pole, and is therefore inert. It creates a whistling and deep warbling plasma sound that reflects its high pitched precision and deep power. The plasma can be colored fairly easily, but it's default is blue because of its temperature. They cut through just about anything except other hard light because of the magnetic repulsion.

Hard Light Swords' sharp edge glows, while the other edge is a flat surface. The handle has a switch that activates the blade, and there's a light cross guard. Built from hexsteel. 

Hard light chakrams are heavy ring like discs with a glowing edge. Built from hexsteel. Will cut through most things but will halt if the metal frame has too much friction or if the ring is caught on something. Ricochets off of hard light.
