### What is it?
It goes by many names. Caldwell's Field, Inverse, The Plane of Creation, The Void, Hell. But these names do not do it justice, because it is not a place. It is not now, not then. It is not here, not there. It is a place of infinite energy, and matter

In our world, life and reality are built on _things_. We are limited by physical laws and finite resources, cursed with the imagination to dream of more but never truly grasp it. Cursed with infinite time and space to fill with what we don't have. 

Caldwell's Field is not this way. Its "life" is born not of matter, but of _meaning_. It is populated by formless entities—manifested ideas given substance within isolated pockets of spacetime. They have no physicality, only **essence**. 

While our minds are complex algorithmic structures with the gift of true innovation, they act entirely on instinct. They are but abstract animals. They don’t think, feel, or possess self-awareness. They simply **are**, carrying out their inscrutable functions in blind obedience to the meanings that birthed them.
### Where did it come from?
No one knows where the Plane of Ideas comes from. It defies categorization and lacks a clear beginning. It isn’t a singular place but rather an amorphous collection of **private universes**, each a microcosm of pure thought. It has no known creator, no discernible purpose. It simply **is**—as ancient and unfathomable as existence itself.
