An Incarnadine Gate is a 4D muscle used for collection of [[Caldwell's Field|Ether]] in the physical world. You either collect the [[Caldwell's Field|Ether]] from your thoughts, or the [[Caldwell's Field|Ether]] of a [[Caldwell's Field|primordial]]. The ladder requires some kind of arrangement, since they probably wouldn't be on board with that otherwise. 

As a muscle, it grows in strength as it's used, allowing more [[Caldwell's Field|Ether]] to be collected. It has no upper limit. It can also get fatigued and stop working. This is easily triggered through excess electrical stimulation.

Due to being 4D, the [[Caldwell's Field|Ether]] you pull can manifest inside of or around its source.

Unless you are extremely disciplined, you won't be able to control your [[Caldwell's Field|Ether]], seeing as it requires absolute focus. Thus, your [[Caldwell's Field|Ether]] primarily acts off subconscious stimuli and instinct. In other words, it amplifies the instincts, desires, dominant thoughts, and other subconscious stimuli of the host.
