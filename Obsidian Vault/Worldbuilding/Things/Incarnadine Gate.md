# General Information
- A 4D muscle that connects one's subconscious to [[Caldwell's Field]] by creating a mobile weak point in space time with boiled [[Nethrium]] that the muscle carefully contains to prevent the heat from spreading. 
- It (by default) connects to the [[Primordial]] version of oneself, which is unbelievably complex and impossibly weak compared to other [[Primordial|primordials]]. However, compared to regular natural life, it's shockingly powerful. They can connect to other [[Primordial]]s, essentially making the user an avatar. 
- It grows in strength as it's used, allowing more resources to be pulled from [[Caldwell's Field]]. It has no upper limit. 
- When resources are pulled, they can manifest inside of or around the source.
- Overuse without rest (which can be easily triggered by excess electrical stimulation) results in muscle failure. This causes temporary loss of access to [[Caldwell's Field]], serious self harm, blood poisoning, or in extreme cases, self destruction. If the damage is too great or lasts too long, the [[Nethrium]] could cool too much and lose it's connection to [[Caldwell's Field]] indefinitely. 
- Primarily acts off subconscious stimuli and instinct. The type stimuli varies from person to person. In other words, it amplifies the instincts, desires, dominant thoughts, and other subconscious stimuli of the host. It can be controlled by thought, but this requires extensive discipline. 

# Natural Incarnadine Gate
- Obtained by projecting natural [[Tessali]] genes into 3D. 
- Develops in strength very efficiently. 

# Faux Incarnadine Gate
- Obtained by sequencing and artificially producing 3D [[Tessali]] genes. 
- Develops in strength inefficiently.
