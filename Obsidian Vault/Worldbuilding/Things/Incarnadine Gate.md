# General Information
- A 4D muscle that connects one's subconscious to [[Caldwell's Field]]. It does this because it contains a tiny fragment of [[Nethrium]], which is an organic material built to do this. 
- It grows in strength as it's used, allowing more resources to be pulled from [[Caldwell's Field]]. It has no upper limit. 
- When resources are pulled, they can manifest inside of or around the source.
- Overuse without rest (which can be easily triggered by excess electrical stimulation) results in muscle failure. This causes temporary loss of access to [[Caldwell's Field]], serious self harm, blood poisoning, or in extreme cases, self destruction. 
- Cannot be controlled by thought, as it acts completely off subconscious stimuli and instinct. The type stimuli varies from person to person. In other words, it amplifies the instincts, desires, dominant thoughts, and other subconscious stimuli of the host. This makes it dangerous if the user is under duress or consumed by overpowering emotions. 

# Natural Incarnadine Gate
- Obtained by projecting natural [[Tessali]] genes into 3D. 
- Develops in strength very efficiently. 

# Faux Incarnadine Gate
- Obtained by sequencing and artificially producing 3D [[Tessali]] genes. 
- Develops in strength inefficiently.
