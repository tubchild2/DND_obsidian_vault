### Description
- A 6" cubic statue of pure [[Nethrium]], engraved with various religious symbols from the [[Doctrine of St. Galling]]. 

### History
1. Created by [[Bradford]] from 10020-10024. It was designed to be superheated and boiled, so that a portal to the Summit (God's domain according to the [[Doctrine of St. Galling]]), could be opened to begin an apocalyptic event that'll destroy all evil. It's name translates to "The Hand of God"
2. Immediately after being completed, it was stolen from its exhibition by [[Pluto]]. Not understanding its purpose, he held on to it. He could never sell it, so he was kind of stuck guarding it and the [[Tessali]]. It's been at the end of his hunt ever since.
