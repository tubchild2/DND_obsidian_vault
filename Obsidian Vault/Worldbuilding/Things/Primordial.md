### Nature
They exist in [[Caldwell's Field]] exclusively. They simply **are**, carrying out their inscrutable functions in blind obedience to the meanings that birthed them. They each have goals that they want to accomplish, but their power and intelligence can change based off the nature and rarity of their concept, so their means at accomplishing these goals can differ greatly. People typically categorize them in two types, but it's really a spectrum between two extremes. 

**Ancient Primordials:**
Ancient, fundamental ideas tend to be much more powerful, but are but abstract animals. They donâ€™t think, feel, or possess self-awareness, but instead simply wait for stimuli and perform their function when necessary. 

**Complex Primordials:**
Complex, rarer known ideas form primordials that are much smarter. They can think, feel, and actively strive to serve their function in the grand universe. Unfortunately, they're significantly weaker, due to being rarer. 

If a primordial were to try and enter our world, it would immediately turn into solid 4D organic sludge (I.E. [[Nethrium]]), and then be spat back out. It's impossible, since it has no physical form. 

### Avatars:
Primordials can only interact with our world around weak points in space time. Around these points, they can attempt to use some of their power to create something. If the weak point isn't strong enough, whatever they create will turn into [[Nethrium]] (organic sludge). If the weak point is strong enough (example: boiling [[Nethrium]]), and they had enough time, they could form an avatar.

Avatars come in many shapes and sizes, but essentially function as containers that sustain that weak point and allow the primordial to influence the real world. The first thing they do with their newfound influence is create a better weak point by forming and subsequently boiling [[Nethrium]]. They then wrap it in the physical form of their choosing. After this, they're more than ready to perform their function in our world. 

It's important to note that avatars are almost always made by complex primordials, as it requires quite a bit of intelligent thought and planning to pull this off.
