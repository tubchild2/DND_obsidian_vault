# History
- When boiled, it becomes a gate to [[Caldwell's Field]] proportionate to the volume of Nethrium boiled.
- Can be found inside of [[Caldwell's Field|Primordial]] Avatars and Theophany.
- Can only be made by a [[Caldwell's Field|Primordial]]. 
# Physical Properties:
- Appearance: solid black, with purple streaks through it. 
- Density: 3g / cm^3
- 4D.
	- It's true structure is beyond our plane of reality. 
	- Can flex spacetime.
	- Impossibly dense, leading to perfect energy distribution. I.E. indestructible and heat-resistant. 
	- The only known material capable of interacting with [[Caldwell's Field]].

# ETC:
- Worth: ~2.853 million credits / gram
- Must be stored extremely carefully, as it can blind you or release ridiculous amounts of radiation.
- Flesh of the [[Tessali]]
- Can only be destroyed by something impossibly hot, or by something else 4D
