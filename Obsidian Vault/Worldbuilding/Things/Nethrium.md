![[Nethrium fragments.png]]
# History
- Can only be made by a [[Primordial]] at a weak spot in spacetime. 
- Typically found in avatars of [[Primordial]]s, as they directly physically connect the [[Primordial]] to the physical world. This loses its connection when the [[Primordial]]'s physical body is destroyed, or when the Nethrium looses its energy. 
# Physical Properties:
- Appearance: solid black, with purple streaks through it. 
- Density: 3g / cm^3
- 4D.
	- It's true structure is beyond our plane of reality. 
	- Can flex spacetime.
	- Impossibly dense, leading to perfect energy distribution. I.E. indestructible and heat-resistant. 
	- The only known material capable of interacting with [[Caldwell's Field]]. When boiled, it opens a tiny gateway. To open a sizeable one, you'd need several cubic feet of the stuff. 

# ETC:
- Worth: ~2.853 million credits / gram
- Must be stored extremely carefully, as it can blind you or release ridiculous amounts of radiation.
- Flesh of the [[Tessali]]
- Can only be destroyed by something impossibly hot, or by something else 4D
