### The Field
Caldwell's Field is a universe devoid of matter, and energy. It's a completely empty space meant to store the thoughts of life. It's a 1x1 scale copy of our universe, except it's completely empty.

### The Particles of the Field
**Ether**
	Ether is a fundamental particle that's native to [[Caldwell's Field]]. It exists as a physical manifestation of an idea. Whenever someone thinks, they produce Ether in [[Caldwell's Field]] that carries the meaning of that idea. The Ether flows through the emptiness, splitting and grouping by meaning. The idea of an Ether particle can only be changed by another sentient being with the means to interact with it. 

1. Whenever Ether enters our world, it manifests its idea into matter, and energy.
2. Whenever matter or energy enters Caldwell's Field, it deconstructs into Ether.

**Unether**
	Ether is an unnatural particle that exists to counter the physics defying nature of Ether. Ether (an unending resource) producing matter and energy breaks the laws of physics. Whenever it does this, an amount of unether particles form equal to the debt created. 

1. Unether cannot exist in Caldwell's Field. It disappears, then reappears in our world if placed there. 
2. Unether particles cannot be moved or interacted with. If an unether particle contacts matter or energy, it absorbs it and vanishes.
3. Unether naturally gravitates to matter, energy, ether, other unether particles, [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]], and Eathyst.
4. If unether contacts ether, the ether is forced to manifest, and is immediately consumed.



---
### Gateways
Gateways can be made by creating a remarkably energy dense point. It's borderline impossible to do this without [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]], which can be boiled or accelerated to borderline lightspeed. Maintaining this point is borderline impossible. 
The size of the gateway formed is equal to the size of the high energy material. For example, 1ft of [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] produces a 1ft gateway. 2ft of [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] produces a 2ft gateway. etc. 
Anything beyond 10ft in diameter allows the formation of Theophany. 



---
### Primordials
**General Information**
	The points where similar Ether collects forms Primordials, which are born not of matter, but of *meaning*. They are manifested ideas. Each Primordial thus has a central idea that they are the representative of. This is called their "thesis." Once a primordial forms, it collects all of the Ether that thesis yields. 
	The Ether that forms a Primordial is what they have to work with. If they run out of Ether, they lose meaning and collapse in on themselves. This means that the primary way to kill a Primordial is to forget its thesis, or to exhaust it.
	Primordials are extremely spread out, and the chances of them running into each other are slim to none. There are a ton of Primordials, but the universe is just far too big of a place.
	Primordials can read the information off Ether. If it formed them, or they interact with it, they can learn where it came from and why it formed. 

**Archaic and Complex Primordials**
	The thesis of a primordial determines everything about their appearance, agenda, intelligence, and power. They typically fall on a spectrum between two extremes.
	Archaic, fundamental theses carry immense Ether, and make the Primordial stronger. However, due to their inherent simplicity, they're unintelligent. Some aren't even aware of their own existence. They're capable of creating [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]]. 
	Complex, new theses allow carry intelligence, and make the Primordial smarter. Though weaker, they can manipulate, plan, and bargain to get what they want. Their power, though significantly lesser, is still nothing to scoff at. 

**Propagation**
	They all serve to propagate the thesis that birthed them. For instance, the Primordial of sticks would want to create and defend sticks, because that would cause more people to think about it, granting it more Ether. 

**Gateway Interaction**
	Gateways form on both sides, meaning Primordials can interact with them. They can use their Ether to manifest matter, energy, and thoughts in our world. However, they're greatly limited until the gateways they interact with are quite large (about 10ft in diameter). Anything they attempt to do before this threshold forms Eathyst in various quantities (see Eathyst).

**Theophany**
- In extraordinarily rare cases, there might exist a gateway that was simultaneously large, fortified, and stable. Primordials cannot physically leave Caldwell's Field because their bodies are made of Ether, and Ether manifests into matter, energy, and thought as soon as it enters our world. 
- However, they gain full control with gateways exceeding 10ft in diameter. After this, they can form a Theophany, which a mobile gateway they can use as a puppet to give them a physical body. They have full access to our world in this form, and can use 100% of their Ether if they wish. 
- An important note is that ancient Theophany have enough excess Ether to form [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] in their bodies, which is a remarkably dense 4D organic material that's borderline indestructible. 
- Primordials can alter their Ether’s meaning, allowing them to do various things, but they are far more proficient in their thesis. While they _could_ act outside it, doing so is inefficient and unnatural, making them disinclined to try.

### Feeders
**General Information**
	The points where unether collects forms Feeders. They're shadowy creatures that seek to not only pay off the debt of their creation, but to destroy Ether pools to prevent further debt accumulation. 
	Though they don't have the Ether of a primordial, their diverse physical forms, strength, ferocity, and ability to deconstruct matter, more than make up for it. See reference table for information on how a debt's size correlates to the type of Feeder it makes.

**Minor Feeder (Cibus Minor)**
	No bigger 8ft, these Feeders are the most common form. They're agile and vicious, these creatures can overwhelm inexperienced Ether users quickly. Though above average in strength and speed, they're barely above average when compared to the monsters of [[the galaxy]]. Their use of unether however is their greatest strength. They have enough to deconstruct a house, though they typically reserve this for the Ether source they're after.

**Intermediate Feeder (Cibus Medius)**
	Typically ranging from 8-16ft, Intermediate Feeders are significantly deadlier. Their strength matches and occasionally outclasses some of the strongest creatures in [[the galaxy]]. They can use their unether much more creatively, and have enough to level a small town, making them much more threatening. Their use of unether blasts and beams are devastating.

**Major Feeder (Cibus Major)**
	From 16-32ft in size, Major Feeders are horrific. Easily physically stronger and faster than any other creature in [[the galaxy]], they pack enough unether to vaporize a country. Can generally destroy a complex primordial theophany by themselves, an an archaic primordial theophany in a group.

**Killing a Feeder**
	There are a few ways to go about killing a Feeder. The only way to destroy them is to expend their unether by exposing it to matter. Minor Feeders can be destroyed through standard combat, but for Intermediate Feeders and beyond, you'll need to dump large quantities of matter, energy, or Ether into them to destroy them.

### Eathyst
**General Information**
- Eathyst is an organic compound that can contain a gateway. 
- Eathyst secretes in the vicinity of gateways. The larger the gateway, the more Eathyst grows.
- Raw Eathyst resembles a copper root with yellow golden gems inside of it. 
- Processed Eathyst is a light tan color, and glows golden. 
- Eathyst responds to electrical stimuli and releases Ether which manifests inside of or around its source. 
- The release of Ether from the gateway grows the Eathyst ever so slightly. This causes it to grow in strength like a muscle when used. This process is slow, and it's much for efficient to condensate. 
- If the internal structure of the Eathyst is compromised, its gateway instantly breaks.

**Eathyst Transference Math**
- By default, raw Eathyst can only produce a set amount of pits per hour 
- However, gateways can be transferred to and from units of Eathyst through a process called "Eathyst Transference". This allows you to increase or decrease the grade of Eathyst. You cannot create gateways from nothing.
	- Node (VII) -> Gem (VI) = Gem (VII)
	- Gem (VI) * 999 -> Gem (VI) = Gem (VII)
	- Gem (VI) * 1000 -> Node (VII) = Node (VII)
- See reference table for more information. 

**Eathyst Transference**
- When liquified, the gateway within Eathyst becomes agitated. 
- When two liquid units of Eathyst are mixed, their gateways collect into one.
- If liquid Eathyst contacts solid Eathyst, the gateway within the liquid will transfer to it. 

**Eathyst Condensation**
- Eathyst farms consist of a gate that's kept open and stable 24/7. Over time, the immediate area around the gates will begin to accumulate Eathyst.
- A gate will produce an amount of Eathyst equal to 1% of the total size of the gate per day. 
- For example, a 1m gate would produce 1cm^3 per day. A 2m gate would produce 2cm^3 per day. A 0.5m gate would produce 0.5cm^3 per day. Etc. 
- 3m is roughly max size for a gateway (for farming purposes), as anything larger risks forming a theophany. 

**Eathyst Pairing**
- Eathyst can be paired to a primordial only with its permission. 
- Paired Eathyst doesn't have a set pit rate, as it entirely depends on the amount the primordial wants to expend. 
- The level of control the avatar has depends on the Primordial. Some will give their Avatars little to no control, and others rely entirely on their judgement. 
- Paired Eathyst implants force constant communication with the primordial. It can't be turned off. 

**Eathyst Trade**
- Smugglers in [[House Galling]]'s upper ranks steal and distribute the material through the black market.
- No other empire have the means to produce it, and [[House Galling]] isn't publicly trading it. It's a very secret material that very few people know anything about it. Rumors have it that [[House Galling]] makes it, but they're unconfirmed. It's incredibly guarded knowledge.

**Other Eathyst Properties**
- Melts at 1,084c
- Boils at 2,562c
- Density: 3g / cm^3
- Worth 375c per gram or 1125c per cubic centimeter

### Eathyst Alloys
**General Information**
	By mixing liquid Eathyst with another liquified metal, you create an Eathyst alloy. Eathyst grade is preserved and unchanged by this process unless specified. Although, it's physical form and properties change to match the metal they're paired with.
**Examples:**
	*E-Copper.* Becomes extra conductive.
	*E-Uranium.* Becomes radioactive, and reactive to radiation. 
	*E-Potassium.* Becomes highly reactive to water. Explodes on contact with water.
	*E-Mercury.* Becomes a liquid at room temperature. 
	*E-[[Exotic Metals|Illidium]].* Becomes borderline indestructible.
	*E-[[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]]*. Indestructible, and capable of storing mass amounts of energy.

### Ether Technology (E-Tech for short)
**General Information**
	Proficiency with E-Tech requires extensive study or training, and an INT of at least 17. It's remarkably complex, given the heavy reliance on microscopic particles and wormholes.
	E-Tech is any machine in which a device (such as a microcomputer) sends electrical signals into Eathyst to generate a predictable response.
	E-Tech can be used to store a spin if its grade is equal to or above the requires Pytes. 
**Artisan's Tools**
	You need E-Tech tools to create or work with E-Tech. These tools allow you to do the following (given you have the materials)
	- Create an Eathyst farm
	- Perform Eathyst transference
	- Build Eathyst devises to perform a spin you know
	- Create Eathyst implants
	- Forge Eathyst alloys
	- ETC.

### Ether Users
There are two ways to become an Ether user, and both require Eathyst. You can get Eathyst implants, or you can get an Eathyst solution injected into your blood. Both function the exact same, but the Eathyst solution is hereditary, especially when used frequently. 

As you use the Eathyst, it'll increase in size and power. This scaling is equivalent to standard D&D leveling for spellcasting classes, and the approaches to using said Ether reflects the class that they're from. 

**No Magical Classes**
	**Sorcerers** inherits Eathyst blood from a parent, giving them innate abilities. 
	**Wizards** study Caldwell's Field, history, and science, and learn to use Ether through discipline.
	**Warlock, Clerics, and Paladins** are avatars, and use Ether according to the Primordial's will.
	**Bards** have Eathyst and can control it through subconscious responses to music. 
	**Druids and Monks** have Eathyst, and use it as an extension of their natural bodies.
	**Artificers** might have Eathyst implants, and work on inventing with Eathyst technology.

### Spins
**General Information**
- Spins are an alternative to spellcasting for this campaign. The names and effects of spells (except for demonic or spiritistic spells) remain in-tact. They're called Spins in-universe. 
- In-universe, Spins are abilities or effects made possible through the use of Ether. Only Ether users or individuals equipped with the appropriate Eathyst-based technology can perform Spins. They are named 'Spins' because, in your mind, you weave and spin Ether into the desired matter or energy form
- A consequence of this is that spells no longer belong to an individual class. If it exists, you want to do it, and your character has the means to do it (flavoring aside), you can do it. 
- All spells can be referenced from the Player's Handbook
