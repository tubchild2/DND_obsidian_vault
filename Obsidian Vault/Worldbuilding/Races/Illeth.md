### History
Prehistory
	They're the native creatures of [[Vivimus]]. Their empire spanned the [[Gorviris]], [[Viviris]], [[Veldiris]], [[Thaldriss]], [[Beholder's Reach]], and [[Grey Mire]] regions. Their capital was [[Gorviris|Carrion Keep]] in [[Gorviris]], which was protected by [[Gorviris|Archer's Pass]]. 
7082
	The [[Fernites|Fernite]] infestation led to rampant geothermal and mutant activity. Their skin was thick enough to resist [[Fernites|Fernite]] infection, and they adapted to the new geological formations and mutant attacks quite well. They increased their military capabilities, which is especially notable in the construction of [[Gorviris|Fennhollow]] outside of [[Gorviris|Mistriven]]. 
7107
	[[House Galling]] attempted to purchase their land, but the Illeth refused. Over the next few years, relations with [[House Galling]] worsened, until communication was completely cut. 
7171
	The [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Inquisitors]] of the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] and [[House Galling]] began their [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Inquisition]]. They picked off their villages and weaker cities in [[Vivere Mori|Viviris]], [[Beholder's Reach]], and [[Grey Mire]], but their capital city of [[Gorviris|Carrion Keep]] was well defended via [[Gorviris|Archer's Pass]]. After wiping out their other cities, an army formed outside of [[Gorviris|Archer's Pass]]. It was impossible to cross without being shot, but there were so many [[Inquisitors]] storming the castle that they ran out of arrows. The Illeth were no match for the [[Inquisitors]]' physically, and the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] enslaved the entire Illeth race for work in the [[Gorviris|Great Mines of Gorviris]], and the [[Grey Mire|inquisitor pits]]. They lived in dirt pits covered by tarps outside of their work stations. Illeth rebels, apostates, and escapees were publicly executed by the [[Inquisitors]].

	The Illeth recovered enough to form a small rebellion called the [[Heretics]]. This original group worked with Emily Galling ([[Bradford]]'s Wife) to get enough insider information to allow [[Pluto]] to steal [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]] and ruin [[House Galling]] / [[Bradford]] / the [[Armstrong Initiative]] / the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|Church of Saint Galling]]'s plans. This was unfortunately short-lived, as just 59 years later, the organization collapses due to in-fighting, and it ends in a bloodbath.

	The Illeth are common slaves. They're servants at [[Grey Mire|Butte Galling]], miners in the [[Gorviris|great mines of Gorviris]], they transport metals, do grunt work in the city / on the battle field, and other physical labor. 
	The [[Heretics]] are reforming under the lead of [[Heretics|Siff Grax]]. Over time, small groups of Illeth escaped and began living in a camp north of [[Viviris]] called [[Heretics|Ollin Hill]]. [[Heretics|Siff]] is forming a rebellion against the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] and [[House Galling]]. He plans to draw the attention of the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Dreadnaves]] away from the mountains, then muster a force to overpower the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|inquisitors]] and free the Illeth in the [[Gorviris|great mines of Gorviris]].
