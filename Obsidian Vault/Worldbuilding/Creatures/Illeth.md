![[The Illeth 2.jpg]]

The native creatures of [[Vivimus]]. They're humble, shorter, and immune to toxins and extreme temperatures. They're weaker than humans, but much more nimble, quiet, and durable. Their vision is excellent, and they don't blink. They need very little hydration to live, and only need to drink a few ounces every few days.

They were created to live on [[Vivimus]]. They built humble settlements that used channels and moats to force the mists and toxic winds away from their homes. 

The [[Fernites|Fernite]] infestation of 7082 led to rampant geothermal activity that destroyed many of their homes. Their skin was thick enough to resist [[Fernites|Fernite]] infestation, but it still left their civilization weakened. 

[[House Galling]] attempted to purchase their land in 7107, but they refused. Over the next few years, relations to the humans worsened, until communication was completely cut. 

In 7171, the [[Inquisitors]] of the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] and [[House Galling]] invaded their homes and enslaved them all. They were forced underground to work in the mines and [[Inquisitors|inquisitor]] pits. They lived in dirt pits covered by tarps. Illeth rebels, apostates, and escapees were publicly executed by the [[Inquisitors]]. 

In 12024, heretics are forming. Over time, small groups of Illeth escaped and began living in the volcanic tunnels and sewers beneath the surface. Their camps move weekly to avoid [[Inquisitors]]. They're forming a rebellion against the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] and [[House Galling]]. They plan to muster a force powerful enough to distract and fight against the [[Inquisitors]], giving them a small window to free the enslaved Illeth.
