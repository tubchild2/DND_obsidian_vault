### Nature
The Primordials exist exclusively in [[Caldwell's Field]], an alternate universe in which the laws of physics do not apply. They are constructed from collectives of ideas that leak from our world into theirs. Each primordial thus has a central idea that they represent. For their survival, it is in their best interest that they form and or propagate their idea in our world. This means that all primordials have an innate goal that they cannot change or defy. They are there to perform a set function, and nothing else. They have no other interests, unless they correlate to the performance of said function. 

They have the ability to create infinite matter and energy, but the rate and scale at which they do this depends on the age of the central idea that bore them. Likewise, intelligence and flexibility in their agenda depends on the complexity of their central idea. This means that they fall on a spectrum between two extremes--Ancient Primordials, and Complex Primordials. 

Ancient Primordials are formed from older, primal ideas. Due to this, they're some of the most powerful primordials in the known universe. However, due to their inherent simplicity, they aren't intelligent. Some debate whether they're even aware of their own existence. They carry out their inscrutable functions in blind obedience to the meanings that birthed them, with no concept of their surroundings or true potential. They simply exist, and wait for the proper stimuli that triggers their instinctual need to fulfill their function. 

Complex Primordials on the other hand are formed from newer, more intricate ideas from the rise of intelligent life. They tend to be unnatural, being formed exclusively from the minds of intelligent life. While weaker, they're much more creative when it comes to carrying out their functions. They can think, plan, and aren't content with being passive. They will perform their function if it's the last thing they do. 

Due to being given life via the thought of intelligent life, the only way to kill a primordial is to forget them. Then, they lose their power, and fade away. They have no physical form, which not only makes them immortal*, but also makes it impossible for them to exist in our world. Whenever a primordial does attempt to enter our world, they're converted in a 4D organic sludge ([[Nethrium]]), and are spat back out.

### Getting into our world anyways
**Envoys**
If one were to create a telepathic link to a primordial through a gate (it doesn't matter how), said primordial would have no issue implanting their agenda into the creature. The process is painful, causes vivid hallucinations, and instills a fear unlike anything natural. After the agenda in implanted, it'll spread throughout their personality, eventually becoming an obsession. They'll try everything in their power to propagate / create the central idea of their patron, through processes that become increasingly religious to them. 

These can occur on any gates from weak onwards. In terms of [[Nethrium]], as long as it's solid or hotter, it works fine. However, once [[Nethrium]] is boiled, this changes. The Primordials become much more aware of the gate, and are absolutely capable of forming telepathic connections on their own fruition. 

**Avatars**
If one already had an unpaired gate that was connected to their mind, a primordial could make a deal with said creature, and make it an avatar. In other words, the primordial would give it power, but it'd need to accomplish the agenda of the patron. 

This can happen in a number of ways. If a gate of gaseous [[Nethrium]] level was too small to form a Theophany, but stable enough to still have limited influence in our world, the primordial could form a telepathic link with someone around them and negotiate the deal instantaneously. The creature does not have to give its permission, but it helps accomplish their goals if they're working with the primordial instead of against it. If they're chosen to be an avatar, they Primordial uses it's brief influence to give the creature a gate that connects their mind to the primordial.
Alternatively, a creature could already have a gate connected to their mind through some external source. Assuming it wasn't paired to any other primordial, one could attempt to negotiate a deal. 

The terms of these deals vary from primordial to primordial. Ancient primordials tend to instill a potent and unshakable obsession in the mind of the creature, but give them their full power 24/7. This gives them a hands-off approach that matches their level of brainpower. Complex primordials on the other hand tend to be more nitpicky about how and when their power is to be used, and have more terms in their agreements. They don't want their power being used on something unrelated, and they don't want their time being wasted. However, they understand that the avatar must get something out of the arrangement, and will negotiate accordingly. 

**Theophany**
If there were to exist a gate that was simultaneously large, and stable (I.E. a large amount of gaseous [[Nethrium]]), a primordial could remove the middle man and create a body for themselves. Like stated earlier, if the gate fails to meet these standards, anything they make will turn into [[Nethrium]] sludge and destabilize the gate. In fact, Primordials won't even attempt to exit unless the gate meets these requirements. However, given the time and circumstances, they can form a Theophany, which is a physical representation of their form in our world. 

Theophanous entities start by using the large, and stable gate to form a better, more stable one. This process takes 5 minutes on average. They typically use boiling [[Nethrium]], as it's much easier to maintain. They then wrap this newfound gate in some kind of container to keep it defended. From this point on, as long as their gate is simultaneously large and stable, they cannot die or be destroyed. They then create their new physical bodies. They typically put the gate inside of their new bodies, but not always. Due to bending spacetime, they do not have to be near it to draw power from it, but it does need to maintain stability. 

After this, they've successfully created a physical embodiment of themselves in our world that can match their power in theirs. This is as powerful as they can possibly be, and are by far the most dangerous. Theophanous entities are uncommon in ancient primordials, due to it requiring quite a bit of planning to pull off. Though, it's not impossible. 

Primordials only form one Theophany, but can have multiple Avatars. They cannot have multiple Theophany, as that would require being absent at all but one of them for extended periods of time, which defeats their whole purpose. Avatars on the other hand they can have multiple of, since they're lower maintenance. 

While in Theophanous form, they typically have a few goals. They want to find Avatars, make Envoys, design servants, and accomplish their function at any cost. While they aren't necessarily hostile, they will use any means to propagate their idea, and if anyone threatens that, the primordial will have no qualms killing them. 

They can create matter and energy at varying rates depending on their type, have complete awareness of every simultaneous instance of their idea throughout the universe, and can create wormholes for travel. They are higher dimensional, meaning they can see with much more than just eyes, and speak telepathically. They are some of the most potent psychic creatures ever known to exist. Unfortunately, their intelligence to act on these goals completely changes their behavior. For example, the primordial of "being a stick", would probably not be that productive. He'd just be a stick. A powerful stick at that, but it probably wouldn't cause all that much of a stir (unless it was a stirring stick, he he he ha)
