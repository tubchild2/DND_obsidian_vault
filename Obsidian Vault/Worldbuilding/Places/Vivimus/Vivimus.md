# Description
The air is heavy and dry, suffused with a choking haze of crimson fog that blankets the landscape as far as the eye can see. The needlelike mountains splinter the burnt-orange sky. The sun, a dull bloated orb, casts a harsh hazy red glow on the planet below, the light diffused from miles of toxic fog. The ground around you is scorched in shades of blood and rust. Around you, rivers of flowing magma careen out of the rocky hillsides, their flow disappearing into a cloud of thick dust. Fierce, searing winds scour the land at hurricane speeds, reducing unprotected structures and unwary wanderers to fragments scattered on the breeze. Charred and snapped bones jut out from the earth, and jets of steam hiss from nearby vents.

# History
Vivimus was a hostile world from the start. From its turbulent formation, the planet had a fiercely volcanic surface wrapped in a choking atmosphere of dense carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and methane. Jagged mountains and mile-deep cliffs defined its landscape, while superheated magma veins and rivers of toxins sliced across the land, their lethal chemicals weaving through valleys and ravines. Although the air shimmered in relentless 95°F heat, life was created to flourish in this extreme climate. The planet became home to unique thermosynthagenic plants and animals—species capable of transforming ambient heat into energy, their bodies built to thrive in the thick, toxic haze and the unending cycle of daylight from Vivimus’ binary stars.

In 7082, scientists from the [[Federation]], seeking a planet secluded enough to conduct dangerous experiments, arrived on Vivimus. They built a hidden research station to test bioweapons—creating a self-replicating organism capable of consuming and transforming organic material. The creation, later known as **[[Fernites]]**, were designed as a thermosynthagenic micro-parasite to spread and violently overtake hosts.
At first, the scientists confined the [[Fernites]] to small enclosures, closely monitoring their rapid replication in the lab’s high-heat environment. But the containment systems were no match for the parasites' invasive nature. Within weeks, the [[Fernites]] breached containment, slipping into the toxic environment outside. Freed to spread across the planet’s surface, they formed dense, spore-filled fogs that rode on the hurricane-force winds, anchoring to plants, animals, and even deep rock layers. This silent, ravenous wave went global in days. Native animals became walking mutations, twisted and cannibalistic, lurching along magma rivers in search of sustenance or squatting in steam vents to drink from the noxious gases spewing from the depths.

By 7083, the entire planet teetered on the edge of collapse. As the [[Fernites]] rooted deep into volcanic systems, they began to influence Vivimus itself. New black volcanoes erupted violently, spewing dark ash, while supermassive steam vents burst unpredictably, uprooting miles of earth and leaving charred, barren craters in their place. The [[Federation]], facing outrage and exposure, destroyed their research station and wiped the surface of their involvement. They claimed the station had been abandoned years before, but rumors persisted. To the few who survived or could still visit Vivimus, they offered a vaccine—for a staggering 900 [[Galactic Standards|credits]]. Crafted with AI-controlled CRISPR technology, the vaccine could inhibit the [[Fernites]]’ growth in human hosts, but did nothing for the ravaged landscape. With no viable solution to eradicate the organisms, the [[Federation]] abandoned Vivimus to its fate.

In 7105, Finn Galling to interest in the planet due to it's abundant thermal energy, chemicals, and rare metals. He set up a small mining colony called Muri Vivi. 

# Physical Characteristics
- Located in the [[The Galaxy|central plate]] of [[the galaxy]]. 
- Black deserts (Entire valleys covered in [[Fernites]])
- Black volcanoes (Volcanic systems overtaken by [[Fernites]]. They spew black magma and erupt more)
- Supermassive steam vents (Steam vents that erupt and uproot square miles of earth)
- Chemical rivers (Ethylene, Arsenic, Petroleum, Ethanol, Butane, Methanol, Manganese Heptoxide, etc.)
- Magma rivers
- Ravines
- Thin, jagged, and sharp mountains. 
- Thin toxic fog
- Mile drop cliffs
- Extreme winds
- Twin suns, only one is visible at a time. The "night" sun is darker, and red. The "day" sun is brighter and orange. Both are hazy due to the fog.
