**Fennhollow Pass**
- Starts as a keep at the base. Where the guards of [[Mistriven]] would stay. 
- An imposing, half-mile high cliff face. The extreme winds and steam vents cause a thick cloud of fog to envelop the upper half of climb. 
- Several watchtowers and stone stairs were put in place to guard [[Mistriven]] from invading mutants. Unfortunately, the steam vents have left large gaps that require creative thinking to get around. 
- As you climb higher, you'll encounter more and more life forms, especially birds and plants, as this is one of the few places that regularly dispenses and collects water. The shade from the cloud keeps some of the cliffs relatively cool.
