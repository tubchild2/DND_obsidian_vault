### Opening Description
- You step out into a deep valley covered in dense fog. It's strange, you didn't know [[Vivimus]] had naturally occurring water, but the mists cover this entire valley. It seems to be pouring from the mountains just south of here, in [[Fennhollow Pass|Fennhollow]] Pass. 
- Ahead of you, peeking out from the fog, is the ruined village of Mistriven. The buildings were made from the charred red and grey rock of [[Vivimus]]. Red and silver plants grow pop from the cobblestone paths of the village. You can't see most of the settlement due to the fog, but it seems to take up most of the valley.
Perception Check?
- Down the main street, in the center of the village, you see a flag planted in a pile of regal corpses. If flows in the thick mist, flaunting a black and red symbol painted on a stitched canvas. 



### Combat Encounter
You hear a thundering screech echo through the valley, followed by the heavy flapping of wings. Black silhouettes emerge from the cliffs, sending boulders tumbling down. It soars towards you, and as it gets closer you see in closer detail it's true form.

A hideous hybrid of a lizard, bird, and bat swoops down and sends a plume of dirt and rocks up into the air as it strikes the ground. It lets out a disgusting mix of gargles and cries, before another thunders behind you. 
(If Twig Blights)
Then, the shrubs around you begins to twitch, before beginning to rise. Their roots pull out from the dirt, and twist together to form the visage of a man. They let out a deep growl, and clench their twisted fists.  

It's an ambush!
Roll initiative.

### Area Descriptions
**The Flag / the Pile of Bodies**
	The symbol on the flag is a black X atop a bloody red circle. It seems to be of a religious nature.
	The bodies beneath don't appear to be human. They're tall, gaunt creatures with no faces. Their regal red and gold robes bear the marks of [[House Galling]], but they're covered in white and red ooze. The smell of rot emanating from the pile stings at your nostrils. 
**Orchard**
- Farms silver trees with red leaves. 
- Overgrown
**Metalworker**
- Processed steel, copper, silver, and a little [[Exotic Metals|Illidium]].
**Tavern**
- The ceilings are lower inside. It's difficult terrain for Taure, Copper, and Bjorn. 
**Farm**
- The farmland has been overtaken by red grass to the point that it looks like a misty red valley. 
**Manor**
- The ceilings are lower inside. It's difficult terrain for Taure, Copper, and Bjorn.
- The mayor of Mistriven lived here. He had a private office w/ a library, as well as a lot of information on the construction of [[Fennhollow Pass]], as well as the conflicts occurring at the other [[Illeth]] settlements. 
**Inn**
- Completely ruined.
**Church**
- Contains a shrine to an unknown [[Illeth]] God. 
**Well**
- Completely dry and dark. Smells rancid, like rotten eggs. 
- Leads to a cavern full of sulfuric acid. DC16 CON saving throw to prevent taking 2d10 acid damage. 
**Watchtower / Archery Point**
- On the far west side of the village lies two towers and a massive gate built into a butte. They're falling apart, and some acid is beginning to condensate and form pools around it.
- Climbing up the tower shows you the chasm of [[Gorviris]], which is flooded with sulfuric acid and toxic mists. A large ancient stone bridge runs across the chasm, allowing passage through the mountains and into [[Beholder's Reach]]. On the right side of the horizon, you see the volcano Mt. [[Gorviris]] gushing molten metals and magma. 
**Port**
- On the far east side of the village lies a river of liquid mercury. Heavy metal barges covered in rust are tethered to silver-wood ports. 
**Approach to [[Fennhollow Pass]]**
- On the south side of the village lies a gargantuan cliff face and mountain range. This path leads to [[Beholder's Reach]], but it looks decrepit.
