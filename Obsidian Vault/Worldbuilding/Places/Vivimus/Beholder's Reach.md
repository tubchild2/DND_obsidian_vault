**General**
- Located on [[Vivimus]]
- Nestled between 6 volcanoes, its a massive network of magma rivers. 
**Chimera Crags**
- A series of charred red stone pinnacles peeking from magma.
- Ruined stone bridges lie scattered and crumbled. 
- The sky is dark due to the hazy red and purple sun, as well as the volcanic ash. 
- Formerly an [[Illeth]] settlement, but it was destroyed during the [[Fernites|Fernite]] infestation of 7082.

**Wyrm's Rest**
- A massive, sprawling, labyrinthine cave system with a large crater like opening.
- Scholars suggest that the caverns used to be a super-volcano that erupted, leaving behind not only the chasm at its surface, but a series of volcanic channels that cooled and formed tunnels.
- It was used by the [[Federation]] some 13000 years ago, and is ground zero for the [[Fernites|Fernite]] outbreak. Consequently, people steer far clear of it for rumors of heightened mutant activity. There are several rusted metal signs clearly warning you to stay away from it. 
- Unfortunately, that made it the perfect hiding spot for [[Pluto]]'s First Trial. 
**Wyrm's Rest--Ground Zero**
- 13000 years ago this was a state of the art underground laboratory. Now, its a pitch blank, rusted, decrepit series of tunnels filled with skeletons. Think of the bunker from Uncharted.
- Due to this being the origin of the [[Fernites]], its one of the most densely mutated areas on [[Vivimus]]. Its a massive mutant hive, and because of this many of the rooms are covered in slime, crawling with monsters, or home to mutant eggs. 
**Wyrm's Rest--[[Pluto]]'s First Trial**
- Located in the depth of Wyrm's Rest, [[Pluto]]'s first trial is an intricately carved wonder. Its shockingly spacious, well decorated, and preserved. 
- Over the past 2000 years, its split due to earthquakes, forcing creative puzzle solutions. 
- It tells the secret history of [[House Galling]], the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]], and the inquisitions of the [[Illeth]]. 
- The Caverns you must periodically pass through contain structures that are alien and unknowable, and are somehow the infrastructure of [[Vivimus]]' ecology. Huge organic glowing structures you can't measure or comprehend, unnatural terrain formations, and places that suggest intelligent design despite not having it, etc. 
- The innermost chamber is guarded by an Ankheg and its babies. Once inside, you get another note from [[Pluto]]. This one sets up what to expect from the hunt, and why he's doing it. He introduces himself and his general lore. He then sets up some mysteries when [[Pluto]] admits that there's a lot he's yet to learn, and does some rambling about this stuff:
	1. How [[Pluto]]'s men entered [[Manor Galling]].
	2. What [[Pluto]] *actually* stole / what the [[Tessali]] *really* is. 
	3. Why the heist went wrong.
	4. What [[House Galling]] wants with the treasure.
	5. What happened to [[Pluto]] after he got the treasure.
