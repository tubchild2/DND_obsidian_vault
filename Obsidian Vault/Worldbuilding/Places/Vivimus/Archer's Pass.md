![[Archer's Pass.jpg]]

**Description**
- Before you lies a great chasm carved into the crimson rock. It stretches out to the left and right further than you can see. A series of small buttes and plateaus peak from the deep bloody fog at the bottom of the ravine. You see solid dark stone bridges connecting the points, forming passages through the divide. 
- In front of you is the central bridge, Archer's Pass, which provides passage directly into the mountains via [[Gorviris|Carrion Keep]], a large dark stone fortress at the far end of the bridge. 
- The bridge is riddled with arrows from the fortress, and malformed tall skeletons are piled on the sides of the bridge. 

History:
- In 7171, The [[Doctrine of St. Galling|Church of Saint Galling]] began an [[Inquisitors|inquisition]] against the [[Illeth]]. The [[Illeth]] had barely associated with the humans, so they were caught off guard. Within days they'd conquered the [[Illeth]] cities in [[Grey Mire]], [[Beholder's Reach]], and [[Viviris]]. The Mountains of [[Gorviris]], specifically [[Gorviris|Carrion Keep]], was the last stand between the [[Illeth]] and the [[Inquisitors|Inquisition]]. Archer's pass bottlenecked their troops, which made it very easy to defend. No enemy had ever crossed the pass unharmed, but the Church had bred an army of [[Inquisitors]]. The [[Illeth]] shot and killed hundreds of [[inquisitors]], but they kept coming. Those monstrous creatures broke down the front gates and seized the [[Illeth]] inside.
