### Description
The thick fog and ash makes the sky a hazy red. Ahead of you lies the chasm of [[Gorviris]], a toxin filled divider between the north and south of [[Vivimus]]. 
A decrepit dark stone bridge runs across the chasm, and directly into the mountains of [[Beholder's reach]]. Rotten deformed skeletons lay piled around the edges of the bridge, their bodies riddled with arrows and stones. The air smells of rot and char, and an intense wind twirls the toxic gasses around the base of the bridge. 

*Facing [[Carrion Keep]]*
[[Gorviris|Mount Gorviris]] grumbles behind you, babbling molten metals down into a series of dark canals. 
At the end of the bridge is a 40ft stone gate leading into the mountains. The doors were smashed in a long time ago, as a thick layer of dust has accumulated around the entrance. 

*Facing [[Gorviris|Mount Gorviris]]*
[[Gorviris|Mount Gorviris]] grumbles ahead of you, babbling molten metals down into a series of dark canals.

What do you do?


### Combat Encounter
You hear a thundering screech echo through the valley, followed by the heavy flapping of wings. Black silhouettes emerge from the cliffs, sending boulders tumbling down. It soars towards you, and as it gets closer you see in closer detail it's true form.

A hideous hybrid of a lizard, bird, and bat swoops down and sends a plume of dirt and rocks up into the air as it strikes the ground. It lets out a disgusting mix of gargles and cries, before another lands behind you. 
(If Twig Blights)
The shrubs around you begins to twitch, before beginning to rise. Their roots pull out from the dirt, and twist together to form the visage of a man. They let out a deep growl, and clench their twisted fists.

### History
7171 
	The [[Doctrine of St. Galling|Church of Saint Galling]] began an [[Inquisitors|inquisition]] against the [[Illeth]]. The [[Illeth]] had barely associated with the humans, so they were caught off guard. Within days they'd conquered the [[Illeth]] cities in [[Grey Mire]], [[Beholder's Reach]], and [[Viviris]]. The Mountains of [[Gorviris]], specifically [[Gorviris|Carrion Keep]], was the last stand between the [[Illeth]] and the [[Inquisitors|Inquisition]]. Archer's pass bottlenecked their troops, which made it very easy to defend. No enemy had ever crossed the pass unharmed, but the Church had bred an army of [[Inquisitors]]. The [[Illeth]] shot and killed hundreds of [[inquisitors]], but they kept coming. Those monstrous creatures broke down the front gates and seized the [[Illeth]] inside.
