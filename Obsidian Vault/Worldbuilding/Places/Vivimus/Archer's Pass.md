### Description
The thick fog and ash makes the sky a hazy red. Ahead of you lies the chasm of [[Gorviris]], a toxin filled divider between the north and south of [[Vivimus]]. 
A decrepit dark stone bridge runs across the chasm, and directly into the mountains of [[Beholder's reach]]. Rotten deformed skeletons lay piled around the edges of the bridge, their bodies riddled with arrows and stones. The air smells of rot and char, and an intense wind twirls the toxic gasses around the base of the bridge. 

*Facing [[Carrion Keep]]*
[[Gorviris|Mount Gorviris]] grumbles behind you, babbling molten metals down into a series of dark canals. 
At the end of the bridge is a 40ft stone gate leading into the mountains. The doors were smashed in a long time ago, as a thick layer of dust has accumulated around the entrance. 

*Facing [[Gorviris|Mount Gorviris]]*
[[Gorviris|Mount Gorviris]] grumbles ahead of you, babbling molten metals down into a series of dark canals.

### History
7171 
	The [[Doctrine of St. Galling|Church of Saint Galling]] began an [[Inquisitors|inquisition]] against the [[Illeth]]. The [[Illeth]] had barely associated with the humans, so they were caught off guard. Within days they'd conquered the [[Illeth]] cities in [[Grey Mire]], [[Beholder's Reach]], and [[Viviris]]. The Mountains of [[Gorviris]], specifically [[Gorviris|Carrion Keep]], was the last stand between the [[Illeth]] and the [[Inquisitors|Inquisition]]. Archer's pass bottlenecked their troops, which made it very easy to defend. No enemy had ever crossed the pass unharmed, but the Church had bred an army of [[Inquisitors]]. The [[Illeth]] shot and killed hundreds of [[inquisitors]], but they kept coming. Those monstrous creatures broke down the front gates and seized the [[Illeth]] inside.
