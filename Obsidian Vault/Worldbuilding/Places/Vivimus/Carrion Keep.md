### History
- The capital of the [[Illeth]] civilization. The first [[Illeth]] settlement was a large underground city in a cavern beneath the keep. It's since caved in. 
- After their defeat at [[Archer's Pass]], the city was left completely undefended, and the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] enslaved the entire [[Illeth]] race for work in the Great Mines.
