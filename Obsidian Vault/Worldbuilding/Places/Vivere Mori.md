# History
In 7105, Finn took interest in the recently corrupted planet of [[Vivimus]]. It was abundant in metals, chemicals, and thermal energy. On top of that, it was so dangerous that it was nearly entirely unclaimed. The surface was still incredibly dangerous due to volcanic activity and the spread of the [[Fernites]]. 
Finn established a religious mining colony called [[Vivere Mori]]. It was sealed in by walls and a glass dome. The abundant resources quickly attracted settlers, then businesses, then immigrants, and soon, an enormous following for the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]]. The [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] was relocated into the city. 

In 7107, the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] and [[House Galling]] were encountering problems with the native people of [[Vivimus]]. The [[Illeth]] are humble creatures that lived underground. Their surface settlements were carved from the earth, and designed with moats and trenches that force the mists and toxic winds into them. They're humble, shorter, and immune to toxins and extreme temperatures. They're weaker than humans, but much more nimble, quiet, and durable. Their vision is excellent, and they don't blink. They need very little hydration to live, and only need to drink a few ounces every few days. Their skin was thick enough to resist the [[Fernites]], but the recent exaggeration of their climate had damaged their civilizations. [[Vivere Mori]] was expanding to its limit due to their land. So, Finn met with the leaders of the [[Illeth]] to establish a deal but the [[Illeth]] refused to give up their land. 

In 7166, [[House Galling]] and its patriarch, as well as the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] and its keeper, formed a plan to conquer the [[Illeth]] territories outside of [[Vivere Mori]]. The [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] would run a religious campaign slandering the [[Illeth]] for their practices and culture. While they were ruining their public campaign, [[House Galling]] would create the [[Inquisitors]]. The [[Inquisitors]] were an army of mindless slaves grown in the pits beneath the city. They would form an army controlled by the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] to execute a holy ware on the [[Illeth]], and capture their land. 

In 7171, the [[Inquisitors|Inquisitor]] army was completed. Public perception of the race had become disgusting, so the holy war begun. The [[Illeth]] had no armies, and stood no chance against the hordes of [[Inquisitors]]. The [[inquisitors]] captured and enslaved the [[Illeth]], and put them to work within the mines and in the [[Inquisitors|Inquisitor]] pits. They lived in small dirt pits covered by tarps. Any rebels, apostates, or escapees were publicly executed using the [[Inquisitors]]. 

By 7222, [[Vivere Mori]] had surpassed one million residents. In light of this, the acting patriarch of [[House Galling]] relocated the headquarters of [[House Galling]] into the center of the city. They wanted to ensure the commercial growth of [[House Galling]] was in-tact. 

Today (12024), the city is still unbelievably profitable and massive, albeit dirty and packed with criminals.

# Description
Muri Vivi is a hub of wealth and industry, but it's prosperity came at a cost. The city is a chaotic tangle of neon lit streets, where criminals and corporations alike vie for power. On the lower levels of the city, it's perpetually dark, only lit by dim florescent lights and holographic ads that assault the senses. The air is thick with grime, and the streets teem with danger. While on the streets, you cannot see the sky thanks to the towering overlap of monolithic structures piled atop one another. 

The planet is extremely dangerous, so the entire city is protected by gargantuan 2000ft high, and 400ft thick black steel walls. It's also protected by a gigantic, 400ft thick glass dome that covers the entire city. there are also extensive underground systems in place to vent gasses and magma out of the city to prevent eruptions. This was meant to keep [[Fernites]], magma, toxic fog, the toxic air, chemical rivers, mutants, extreme winds, and filter the intense sunlight. The city is a circle with a 60 mile diameter, which is split into 31 6-mile slices.
