# History
- In 7105, [[House Galling]] established the city as a small mining colony to take advantage of the abundant chemical, thermal, and mineral deposits of [[Vivimus]]. Then, it was so god dang profitable, had so much cheap metal and power, and had such cheap property, that he accidentally began attracting business owners, [[Federation]] scientists, farmers, and families. 
- In 7222, Vivere Mori had well over million residents, so [[House Galling]] decided to move their HQ from their family manor into the city.  
- In 10024, The [[Armstrong Initiative]] relocates to an underground complex in Vivere Mori.
- By today (12024), the city is still unbelievably profitable and massive, albeit dirty and packed with criminals.

# Description
Muri Vivi is a hub of wealth and industry, but it's prosperity came at a cost. The city is a chaotic tangle of neon lit streets, where criminals and corporations alike vie for power. On the lower levels of the city, it's perpetually dark, only lit by dim florescent lights and holographic ads that assault the senses. The air is thick with grime, and the streets teem with danger. While on the streets, you cannot see the sky thanks to the towering overlap of monolithic structures piled atop one another. 

The planet is extremely dangerous, so the entire city is protected by gargantuan 2000ft high, and 400ft thick black steel walls. It's also protected by a gigantic, 400ft thick glass dome that covers the entire city. there are also extensive underground systems in place to vent gasses and magma out of the city to prevent eruptions. This was meant to keep [[Fernites]], magma, toxic fog, the toxic air, chemical rivers, mutants, extreme winds, and filter the intense sunlight. The city is a circle with a 60 mile diameter, which is split into 31 6-mile slices.
