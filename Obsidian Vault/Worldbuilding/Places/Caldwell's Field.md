### The Field
Caldwell's Field is a universe devoid of matter, and energy. It's a completely empty space meant to store the thoughts of life.

### The Particles of the Field
**Ether**
	Ether is a fundamental particle that's native to [[Caldwell's Field]].Â It exists as a physical manifestation of an idea. Whenever someone thinks, they produce Ether in [[Caldwell's Field]] that carries the meaning of that idea. The Ether flows through the emptiness, splitting and grouping by meaning. 

1. Whenever Ether enters our world, it manifests its idea into matter, and energy.
2. Whenever matter or energy enters Caldwell's Field, it deconstructs into Ether.

**Unether**
	Ether is an unnatural particle that exists to counter the physics defying nature of Ether. Ether (an unending resource) producing matter and energy breaks the laws of physics. Whenever it does this, an amount of unether particles form equal to the debt created. 

1. Unether cannot exist in Caldwell's Field. It disappears, then reappears in our world if placed there. 
2. Unether particles cannot be moved or interacted with. If an unether particle contacts matter or energy, it absorbs it and vanishes.
3. Unether naturally gravitates to matter, energy, ether, other unether particles, [[Nethrium]], and Eathyst.
4. If unether contacts ether, the ether is forced to manifest, and is immediately consumed.

### Primordials
**General Information**
	The points where similar Ether collects forms Primordials, which are born not of matter, but of *meaning*. They are manifested ideas. Each Primordial thus has a central idea that they are the representative of. This is called their "thesis." Once a primordial forms, it collects all of the Ether that thesis yields. 
	The Ether that forms a Primordial is what they have to work with. If they run out of Ether, they lose meaning and collapse in on themselves. This means that the primary way to kill a Primordial is to forget its thesis, or the exhaust it.

**Archaic and Complex Primordials**
	The thesis of a primordial determines everything about their appearance, agenda, intelligence, and power. They typically fall on a spectrum between two extremes.
	Archaic, fundamental theses carry immense Ether, and make the Primordial stronger. However, due to their inherent simplicity, they're unintelligent. Some aren't even aware of their own existence. Their power is measured in quadrapytes. 
	Complex, new theses allow carry intelligence, and make the Primordial smarter. Though weaker, they can manipulate, plan, and bargain to get what they want. Their power, though significantly weaker, is still nothing to scoff at. Typically measured in the upper trillapytes. 

**Propagation**
	They all serve to propagate the thesis that birthed them. For instance, the Primordial of sticks would want to create and defend sticks, because that would cause more people to think about it, granting it more Ether. 

**Envoys**
	Forming a telepathic link with a primordial allows the inherently psychological being to implant its thesis into your mind. This process causes vivid hallucinations, and causes loud voices in your mind that tempt you to carry out the function of the primordial. They'll feel an overwhelming urge to propagate the thesis.

**Avatars**
	If one were to bargain with a primordial, they may become an Envoy with benefits, or an avatar. They are given a paired Eathyst implant to grant them access to the Primordials' Ether.
	The terms of these arrangements differ from Primordial to Primordial. 
		- Archaic primordials tend to grant immense, uncontrollable power. They give them unwavering access of a large sum of their power. However, Archaic primordials will constantly drill their thesis into the mind of the avatar. From their perspective, it feels like someone is constantly yelling in your ear to do something. 
		- Complex primordials tend to grant focused, precise power, with other specified costs, and take frequent use of their ability to communicate to tell the Avatar what to do. They also might not even give the Avatar full control of its power, instead opting to be more hands-on and control it themselves.
	If you fail, and end up costing more ether than you propagate, your Eathyst is unpaired, and reverted back to standard raw Eathyst.

**Theophany**
	In extraordinarily rare cases, there might exist a gateway that was simultaneously large, fortified, and stable. Primordials cannot physically leave Caldwell's Field because their bodies are made of Ether, and Ether manifests into matter, energy, and thought as soon as it enters our world. However, they can create a physical body that they puppet FROM Caldwell's Field.
	The formation of a Theophany has 4 stages. 
		First, the Primordial creates a gateway that connects them to the body. 
		Second, the Primordial places it in a node of Eathyst. 
		Third, the Primordial coats it in [[Nethrium]] to defend it.
		Fourth, the Primordial forms a physical body around it that they can control.

### Feeders
**General Information**
	The points where unether collects forms Feeders. They're shadowy creatures that seek to not only pay off the debt of their creation, but to destroy Ether pools to prevent further debt accumulation. 
	Though they don't have the Ether of a primordial, their diverse physical forms, strength, ferocity, and ability to deconstruct matter, more than make up for it. See reference table for information on how a debt's size correlates to the type of Feeder it makes.

**Minor Feeder (Cibus Minor)**
	No bigger 8ft, these Feeders are the most common form. They're agile and vicious, these creatures can overwhelm inexperienced Ether users quickly. Though above average in strength and speed, they're barely above average when compared to the monsters of [[the galaxy]]. Their use of unether however is their greatest strength. They have enough to deconstruct a house, though they typically reserve this for the Ether source they're after.

**Intermediate Feeder (Cibus Medius)**
	Typically ranging from 8-16ft, Intermediate Feeders are significantly deadlier. Their strength matches and occasionally outclasses some of the strongest creatures in [[the galaxy]]. They can use their unether much more creatively, and have enough to level a small town, making them much more threatening. Their use of unether blasts and beams are devastating.

**Major Feeder (Cibus Major)**
	From 16-32ft in size, Major Feeders are horrific. Easily physically stronger and faster than any other creature in [[the galaxy]], they pack enough unether to vaporize a country. Can generally destroy a complex primordial theophany by themselves, an an archaic primordial theophany in a group.

**Killing a Feeder**
	There are a few ways to go about killing a Feeder. The only way to destroy them is to expend their unether by exposing it to matter. Minor Feeders can be destroyed through standard combat, but for Intermediate Feeders and beyond, you'll need to dump large quantities of matter, energy, or Ether into them to destroy them.

### Gateways
Creating a gateway between two worlds requires a material that's remarkably energy dense, such as [[Nethrium]]. Whenever materials like this move, they flex spacetime ever so slightly. It's not really noticeable until you accelerate to speeds near the speed of light. Then, the rifts left behind become much larger and more notable. By spinning this material in a circle at those speeds, you can open gateway. However, maintaining this speed requires an immense amount of energy.

### Eathyst
**General Information**
- Eathyst is an organic compound that can contain a gateway. Eathyst grows naturally in the vicinity of open gateways. The larger the gateway, the more Eathyst grows.
- Eathyst responds to electrical stimuli and releases Ether which manifests inside of or around its source. 
- The release of Ether from the gateway grows the Eathyst ever so slightly. This causes it to grow in strength like a muscle when used. This process is slow, and it's much for efficient to condensate. 
- If the internal structure of the Eathyst is compromised, its gateway instantly breaks.

**Eathyst Transference Math**
- By default, raw Eathyst can only produce a set amount of pits per hour 
- However, gateways can be transferred to and from units of Eathyst. This allows you to increase or decrease the grade of Eathyst. You cannot create gateways from nothing.
	- Node (VII) -> Gem (VI) = Gem (VII)
	- Gem (VI) * 999 -> Gem (VI) = Gem (VII)
	- Gem (VI) * 1000 -> Node (VII) = Node (VII)
- See reference table for more information. 

**Eathyst Transference Techniques**
- *Forging.* By liquifying and pooling the Eathyst, the gateways will flow together and form one large gate that can be extracted with a scoop. This yields exclusively bowling ball sized Eathyst, but can be done in bulk.
- *Via Lab.* By establishing a one way bridge between two units of Eathyst, you can pull the gateway out of one and into another. A slower process, but allows for more control when it comes to sizes and shapes. 

**Eathyst Condensation**
- Eathyst farms consist of a gate that's kept open and stable 24/7. Over time, the immediate area around the gates will begin to accumulate Eathyst.
- A gate will produce an amount of Eathyst equal to 1% of the total size of the gate per day. 
- For example, a 1m gate would produce 1cm^3 per day. A 2m gate would produce 2cm^3 per day. A 0.5m gate would produce 0.5cm^3 per day. Etc. 

**Eathyst Pairing**
- Eathyst can be paired to a primordial only with its permission. 
- Paired Eathyst doesn't have a set pit rate, as it entirely depends on the amount the primordial wants to expend. 
- The level of control the avatar has depends on the Primordial. Some will give their Avatars little to no control, and others rely entirely on their judgement. 
- Paired Eathyst implants force constant communication with the primordial. It can't be turned off. 

**Eathyst Trade**
- Smugglers in [[House Galling]]'s upper ranks steal and distribute the material through the black market.
- No other empire have the means to produce it, and [[House Galling]] isn't publicly trading it. It's a very secret material that very few people know anything about it. Rumors have it that [[House Galling]] makes it, but they're unconfirmed. It's incredibly guarded knowledge.

**Other Eathyst Properties**
- Melts at 1,084c
- Boils at 2,562c
- Density: 3g / cm^3
- Worth 375c per gram or 1125c per cubic centimeter

### Non-Primordial Ether Users
There are two ways to become an Ether user, and both require Eathyst. You can get Eathyst implants, or you can get an Eathyst solution injected into your blood. Both function the exact same, but the Eathyst solution is hereditary, especially when used frequently. 

As you use the Eathyst, it'll increase in size and power. This scaling is equivalent to standard D&D leveling for [[Spins|spellcasting]] classes, and the approaches to using said Ether reflects the class that they're from. 

**No Magical Classes**
	**Sorcerers** inherits Eathyst blood from a parent, giving them innate abilities. 
	**Wizards** study Caldwell's Field, history, and science, and learn to use Ether through discipline.
	**Warlock, Clerics, and Paladins** are avatars, and use Ether according to the Primordial's will.
	**Bards** have Eathyst and can control it through subconscious responses to music. 
	**Druids and Monks** have Eathyst, and use it as an extension of their natural bodies.
	**Artificers** might have Eathyst implants, and work on inventing with Eathyst technology.
