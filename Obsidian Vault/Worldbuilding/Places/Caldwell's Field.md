### The Field
Caldwell's Field is a universe devoid of matter, and energy. It's a completely empty space meant to store the thoughts of life.

### Ether
Ether is a fundamental energy and particle that's native to [[Caldwell's Field]].Â It exists as a physical manifestation of an idea. Whenever someone thinks, they produce Ether in [[Caldwell's Field]] that carries the meaning of that idea. The Ether flows through the emptiness, splitting and reorganizing by meaning. 

Whenever Ether exists in our world, the meaning it carries manifests into matter, thought, or energy.

### Primordials
These points where similar ideas collect form Primordials, which are born not of matter, but of *meaning*. They are manifested ideas. Each Primordial thus has a central idea that they are the representative of. This is called their "thesis." Once a primordial forms, it collects all of the Ether that thesis yields. 
The Ether that forms a Primordial is what they have to work with. If they run out of Ether, they lose meaning and collapse in on themselves. This means that the primary way to kill a Primordial is to forget its thesis, or the exhaust it.

**Ancient and Complex Primordials**
The thesis of a primordial determines everything about their appearance, agenda, intelligence, and power. They typically fall on a spectrum between two extremes.
Ancient, fundamental theses carry immense Ether, and make the Primordial stronger. However, due to their inherent simplicity, they're unintelligent. Some aren't even aware of their own existence. 
Complex, new theses allow carry intelligence, and make the Primordial smarter. Though weaker, they can manipulate, plan, and bargain to get what they want. 

**Propagation**
They all serve to propagate the thesis that birthed them. For instance, the Primordial of sticks would want to create and defend sticks, because that would cause more people to think about it, granting it more Ether. 

**Envoys**
Forming a telepathic link with a primordial allows the inherently psychological being to implant its thesis into your mind. This process causes vivid hallucinations, and causes loud voices in your mind that tempt you to carry out the function of the primordial. They'll feel an overwhelming urge to propagate the thesis.

**Avatars**
If one were to bargain with a primordial, they may become an Envoy with benefits, or an avatar. They are given an [[Incarnadine Gate]] to grant them access to the Primordials' Ether.
The terms of these arrangements differ from Primordial to Primordial. Ancient primordials tend to grant immense, uncontrollable power, at the cost of insanity. Complex primordials tend to grant focused, precise power, and enhanced intelligence, with other specified costs, and a more intense desire to propagate the thesis. If you fail, and end up costing more ether than you produce, you lose your power, but keep the [[Incarnadine Gate]]. 

**Theophany**
In extraordinarily rare cases, there might exist a gate that was simultaneously gigantic, fortified, and stable. Though Primordials cannot leave Caldwell's Field **and** keep their power, they can create their own bodies using Ether. 
The formation of a Theophany has 2 stages. First, the Primordial creates an [[incarnadine gate]] that connects to them. Second, the Primordial wraps it in a physical representation of their forms. 
This creates a body that's extremely hard to kill, immensely powerful, and 100% under the control of the Primordial.

### Gateways
It is neigh impossible to create a gateway between these two worlds. The only practical method of creating a gate is by boiling [[Nethrium]], which is an expensive and difficult task. The issue is that [[Nethrium]] can only be made by a primordial via an Avatar or Theophany. 
There are other ways of creating gateways, but they have their own issues. [[Incarnadine Gate|Incarnadine Gates]] are gateways, but they can (once again) only form via an Avatar or Theophany. 
The only other way is by creating something remarkably energy dense (typically [[Nethrium]], but that's off the table). Something like a black hole would work, but good luck getting anything out of there.

### History
It was created to exist in tandem with the universe. 

After the creation of mankind and other intelligent life, the primal, fundamental [[Primordial|primordials]] came into being. 

As life grew, so did the power and intelligence of both the fundamental and complex [[Primordial|primordials]].
