It goes by many names. Caldwell's Field, Inverse, The Plane of Creation, The Void, etc. These names do not do it justice. It isn’t a singular place but rather an amorphous soup of **private universes**, each a microcosm of pure potential. 

In our world, life and reality are built on _things_. We are limited by physical laws and finite resources, cursed with the imagination to dream of more but never truly grasp it. We have infinite time and space to fill with *things* that we don't have. 

Caldwell's Field is not this way. Its "life" is born not of matter, but of _meaning_. It is populated by formless entities—manifested ideas. They are known as [[Primordial]]. 

[[Primordial]] cannot exist in the physical world, and physical matter / energy cannot exist in the field. [[Primordial]] get around this by making physical bodies, but in order to interact with them, they need some kind of organic gateway made via [[Nethrium]]. 


### History
In the year negative infinity, the field is formed. Though predating creation, it functionally exists in tandem with the universe.

After the creation of mankind and other intelligent life, the primal, fundamental primordials came into being. 

As life grew, so did the power and intelligence of both the fundamental and complex primordials.
