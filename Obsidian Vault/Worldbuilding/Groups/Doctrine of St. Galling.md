## History
The Doctrine of St. Galling began in 7096 as a set of philosophical beliefs created by Finn Galling. Initially, it was a collection of ideas about progress, wealth, and success, intended as secular guidance rather than religious law. Over time, however, Finn Galling’s writings were subtly altered and reinterpreted to frame them as divine laws governing the universe and the will of God.

By 7222, as [[House Galling]] rose to prominence and sought justification for increasingly criminal and self-serving behavior, these teachings were transformed into the foundation of a burgeoning religion. Over thousands of years, these warped interpretations became canonized, treated as gospel, and revered with utmost respect. However, this institutionalized faith has led to dark practices such as ritual sacrifice, self-mutilation, cannibalism, and systemic mistreatment of the poor and marginalized, even extending to genocide.

## Lessons
The Doctrine of St. Galling revolves around strict principles regarding divinity, destiny, and hierarchy:

#### Core Beliefs
- **A Single, Nameless God**: Followers believe in one God who serves as the ultimate lawgiver and judge.
- **Predestined Destiny**: Every person’s fate is predetermined by God. 
- **Immutable Hierarchy**: The universe operates within a rigid, divine hierarchy that reflects the natural order established by God.
- **The Rapture**: We are living in the "era of judgement," a time when you can make choices to try and climb as high on the hierarchy as possible. Once this era ends, God will enter our dominion and hand out judgement to the world. The followers will go The Summit (heaven), and the scorned will go to The Mire (hell).

#### Hierarchy and Power
- **Real-World Reflections**: The hierarchy correlates directly with real-world power and influence. Those born into power are seen as inherently divine, while the powerless are deemed flawed.
- **Predetermined Status**: Movement within the hierarchy is seen as God’s will; if someone changes rank, it was always meant to happen.
- **Wealth as Divine Favor**: Material success and wealth are viewed as rewards from God for righteous living.
- **Atonement and Sacrifice**: Mistakes lower one’s status in the hierarchy. Redemption requires repayment through significant sacrifices to the church and God. The value of the sacrifice is measured by the suffering it causes the individual, making ascension almost unattainable for average believers.

#### Human Nature and Discipline
- **Purity of Instinct**: Humanity’s “pure” instincts have been corrupted by modern philosophies. Followers are taught to trust their gut and reject intellectual doubt, as ignoring instinct is seen as weakness born of fear.
- **The Summit and the Mire**: The followers are promised a heavenly afterlife of complete freedom in The Summit, a mountainous paradise. The scorned are condemned to eternal torment without free will in The Mire, a disgusting well of filth. 
- **Self-Discipline**: True salvation lies in discipline, both self-imposed and enforced by superiors. Personal discipline reflects one’s dedication to God.
- **Parental Responsibility**: Parents are commanded to teach their children the Doctrine early, as neglecting this duty is believed to result in suffering for the child.
- **Financial Contributions**: Regular funding of the church is mandatory to maintain one’s faith and standing within the hierarchy.

2. **The Keeper**: The supreme leader of the organization, responsible for interpreting and upholding the faith.
3. **Judge**: Prominent representatives of the religion who manage publicity, deliver judgments, and embody the church’s authority. They are considered equal to, or even greater than, Cardinals.

6. **Bishop**: Supervisors of multiple churches within a specific area.
