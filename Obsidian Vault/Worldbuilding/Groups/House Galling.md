![[House Galling.png]]

In 7096, St. Finn Galling pens the [[Doctrine of St. Galling]], and starts his religion. 

In 7100, St. Finn Galling establishes the house with the [[Federation]] as a small, family managed asteroid mining business. By the end of the year, they amassed a small fortune. 

In 7105, St. Finn Galling took interest in a fiery dead planet called [[Vivimus]]. It was abundant in thermal energy, chemicals, and rare metals, so he set up a small mining colony called [[Vivere Mori]]. It turned out to be so god dang profitable that he quickly began attracting business owners, [[Federation]] scientists, farmers, family heads, smugglers, pirates, and more. 

In 7222, [[Vivere Mori]] had well over million residents, so House Galling decided to move their HQ from their family manor into the city. It's also important to note that this point marks when most people consider the original [[Doctrine of St. Galling]] to be completely morphed into the cruel religion we see today. 

In 9992. Simeon Galling reactivates a private version of the [[Armstrong Initiative]] to try and cheat death, as he was getting older and wanted to extend his life. Their HQ was beneath Old [[Manor Galling]].

In 10012, Simeon Galling uncovers the [[Tessali]] on an asteroid excavation mission. It was sleeping in a tiny asteroid, which seems to have formed around it. They capture it and bring it to the [[Armstrong Initiative]] for study. Then they discover [[Nethrium]]. They immediately begin farming and selling it. By the end of the year, they're the most wealthy and corrupt people in [[the galaxy]]. 

In 10018, Simeon Galling is on his deathbed. Noting how sociopathic his son [[Bradford]] was, he elected to give his position as family patriarch to his nephew instead. His nephew (Timothy Galling) was 9 years old at the time. After learning this, [[Bradford]] entered their home at night, and strangled him. He then beat his entire family to death. He then went and poisoned his father, before altering his will to make himself the heir once more. 

In 10020, the [[Armstrong Initiative]] begins to research [[Caldwell's Field]], and Incarnadine Gates. [[Bradford]] takes interest in this, because he believes he can start the rapture (a teaching of the [[Doctrine of St. Galling]]) by opening a portal to the field. He invests nearly the entirety of House Galling's [[Nethrium]] into a 6ft statue designed to be boiled that he calls "[[Mano di Dio]]."

In 10024, [[Pluto]] robs Old [[Manor Galling]]. During the heist, he discovers the [[Armstrong Initiative]], as well as the [[Tessali]]. He frees everyone and burns the [[Armstrong Initiative]] (as well as [[Manor Galling]]) down. The heist devolves into a firefight engulfed in flames. [[Pluto]]'s men revolt, so [[Pluto]] leaves them to die. [[Pluto]] escapes with the [[Tessali]], as well as [[Mano di Dio]], a 6ft statue made from majority of the Galling's [[Nethrium]] supply that's worth over 404 billion credits, and designed to begin an apocalyptic event from the teachings of the [[Doctrine of St. Galling]]. In response to it being stolen, [[Bradford]] strangles [[Pluto]]'s friends and family, and anyone present during the heist (including his own men). He then relentlessly pursues [[Pluto]] with an army of bounty hunters, but to avail. The [[Armstrong Initiative]] is relocated to an underground complex in [[Vivere Mori]], and [[Manor Galling]] is rebuilt in [[Vivimus]]. 

In 10065, the reactivated [[Armstrong Initiative]] finished the N53v13 Formula. [[Bradford]] takes the formula on his deathbed, and is restored to his youth. He vowed to use his strength to find [[Pluto]], and find [[Mano di Dio]]. He begins using his lowest-ranking employees to search locations for him. 

In 11970, [[Bradford]] begins enacting genocides and wars against weaker races and empires to gain land, framing it as a holy war.
