7070 
	The Armstrong Initiative is founded by the [[Federation]] to produce humans that could match the rest of [[the galaxy]]'s powerful creatures.

7081 
	The [[Federation]] has the initiative experiment with bioweaponry. They moved onto [[Vivimus]] and established a secure underground bunker in [[Beholder's Reach|Wyrm's Rest]]. During testing, a scientist named Mikhail Volkov created the [[Fernites|Fernite]], a creature designed to be as adaptable and viral as possible. It spread to him, and to the other scientists within minutes. The mutations followed soon after, as the creatures nearby were given part human DNA. The [[Fernites]] rapidly spread through [[Beholder's Reach|Wyrm's Rest]], and emerged onto the surface via geysers and eruptions within days. Once the [[Federation]] was informed, it was far too late. The virus was spreading far faster and more aggressively than they could contain. It quickly overtook the planet, so the initiative destroyed all evidence of their involvement.

	The initiative had completed its task, though in a very cruel way. They were experimenting on children, and seriously harming many of them. However, their experiments led to the production of the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnaves]] via the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnave]] serum. 

9992
- [[House Galling|Patriarch]] Simeon Galling of [[House Galling]] reactivates the Armstrong Initiative to serve as an R&D foundation for [[House Galling]] on [[Vivere Mori]]. Additionally, this would give him a use for the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|scorned]] ([[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] teaching) aside from simply executing them. Research into weapons and soldiers could additionally help sustain [[House Galling]]'s power.
- Their HQ was under [[House Galling]], and was a sprawling concrete bunker. 
- They quickly produce a new breed of [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnaves]] using the techniques used to breed the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|inquisitors]]. These new [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnaves]] were more obedient, and could be bred in bulk via the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|inquisitor]] pits. 

10001
- The initiative creates the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|pundits]], and elite [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnaves]]. [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Pundits]] are frail creatures with enhanced intelligence, but skin vulnerable to radiation. Elite [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnaves]] are [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnaves]] with [[CSG and HG Soldiers|pundit]] intelligence, [[Illidium]] armor, and higher caliber weapons. 

10020
- They take notice of the [[Tessali]]'s healing factor. It wasn't eating or drinking, so where were those resources coming from? They called this extradimensional source "[[Caldwell's Field]]", and sought to access it. 
- Around this time, they also noted strange, almost portal-like phenomena exhibited by [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] when highly energized. They temporarily expended a large amount of their [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] supply to create a large [[Caldwell's Field|Gateway]]. Nothing of note happened.
- A few weeks later, [[Bradford]] spoke with the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] and the Armstrong Initiative to produce [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]], which was a [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] statue meant to create a larger, more stable [[Caldwell's Field|Gateway]]. The Armstrong Initiative agreed, since they saw it as a potential means to create an infinite energy source. 

10024
	The Armstrong Initiative HQ beneath [[Manor Galling]] burns down during [[Pluto]]'s heist. During the heist, the [[Mano di Dio]] and the [[Tessali]] are stolen, locking [[Bradford]], the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]], and the Initiative out of their plans. They rebuild and move to a new complex in [[Grey Mire]], near the new [[The Royal Palace of House Galling|royal palace]]. 

10065 
	They successfully condensate a couple grams of [[Caldwell's Field|Eathyst]]. [[Caldwell's Field|Eathyst]] turned out to be a remarkably complex material that would require centuries to master. Unlike with [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]], they kept the [[Caldwell's Field|Eathyst]] to themselves, because it took so long to make.
	With a 0.5m gate left constantly open (which was the most they could afford), they could condensate ~0.5cm^3 of [[Caldwell's Field|Eathyst]] per day.

11687
	Their [[Caldwell's Field|Eathyst]] research yielded the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Templars]]. By injecting their blood with high concentrations [[Caldwell's Field|Eathyst]], they gave them extremely powerful, yet unpredictable abilities.

12000
	They begin testing their [[Caldwell's Field|Eathyst]] supply on certain materials, plants, animals, and children. One of which was a 6 year old lion named [[Copper (PC)]]. They tested him in the standard initiative for months, and when he proved capable, they gave him [[Caldwell's Field|Eathyst]] implants and [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Pundit]] intelligence. He responded quite well to music, and was capable of semi-regularly controlling his abilities with it. They planned to execute him regardless to get the [[Caldwell's Field|Eathyst]] back, but he was saved by an employee and dumped into the real world. 

12024 (today)
	They finished perfecting their greatest weapon yet. The [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Sanctumborne]] are the apex of everything they've learned. They outclass all other units in strength, speed, endurance, intelligence, and [[Caldwell's Field|Ether]] funneling. They're lab grown, then subjected to extreme condition. 98% of [[CSG and HG Soldiers|sanctumborne]] prospects die during the process, making them remarkably uncommon. 
	There is only one [[CSG and HG Soldiers|sanctumborne]]--[[the Fist of House Galling]].
