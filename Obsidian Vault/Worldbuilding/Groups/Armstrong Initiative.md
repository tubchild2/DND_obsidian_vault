In 7070, two unknown aliens land on earth. The [[Federation]] quickly apprehended and interrogated them. They inform humans that they're the bottom of the food chain, and that [[the galaxy]] is teeming with advanced, dangerous life. Out of fear, they greenlight the Armstrong Initiative to make humans genetically superior to their alien counterparts.

In 7071, The [[Federation]] establishes FTL travel and long-distance communication by using the aliens' technology. Trade deals begin being made, and human technology enters the galactic era. 

By 7116, the initiative had gone off the deep end. General Hawthorne had developed sociopathic tendencies, and was performing deadly experiments on young children in an attempt to make them gods. Feeling much more comfortable in their place in [[the galaxy]], the [[Federation]] shuts the initiative down. 

In 9992, Simeon Galling purchases and privately reactivates the Armstrong Initiative. He wants to continue their research because he's getting old, and he fears death. He hides it beneath [[Manor Galling]]. Without restrictions, the initiative quickly corrupts and becomes a seeping pool of revolting human filth. They're experimenting on kids, killing most of them, and torturing the rest. It's no longer about protecting humanity, it's about transcending it. They're more concerned with manipulating human biology and creating super-beings than anything resembling scientific inquiry. 

In 10020, they take notice of the [[Tessali]]'s healing factor. It wasn't eating or drinking, so where were those resources coming from? They called this extradimensional source "[[Caldwell's Field]]", and sought to access it. 
The [[Tessali]] had a higher dimensional muscle they called the [[Incarnadine Gate]]. Resources from [[Caldwell's Field]] could be manifested by the [[Tessali]] using this muscle. By extracting the genes that led to the growth of this muscle, they could potentially give this ability to other creatures. However, the [[Tessali]]'s DNA was 4D. It was fragmented, confusing, and would be borderline impossible to sequence. They'd need a lot of [[Tessali]] flesh, and a lot of time, but it was possible. 
The other way to access [[Caldwell's Field]] was through boiling [[Nethrium]]. They superheated a single gram of [[Nethrium]] and opened a portal for a single millisecond. [[Bradford]] took interest in this. Due to some religious reasons, he wanted to open a much larger portal. The initiative didn't mind, because they believed that creating a machine to open a larger portal could create a sustainable infinite power source. [[Bradford]]'s faith was so great, that he willingly spent 404 billion credits of [[Nethrium]] (almost their family's whole supply) to create the statue. [[Bradford]] named it "[[Mano di Dio]]"

In 10024, the Armstrong Initiative HQ beneath [[Manor Galling]] burns down during [[Pluto]]'s heist. During the heist, [[Mano di Dio]] and the [[Tessali]] are stolen, locking [[Bradford]] and the Initiative out of their plans. They rebuild and move to a new location on [[Vivere Mori]].

In 10065, they successfully extracted and projected the [[Tessali]]'s genes into a 3D form. They wanted to create more copies, but [[Bradford]] forced them to create the N53v13 formula. It was designed to facilitate the growth of a natural [[Incarnadine Gate]], and to potentially restore youth. It was taken by [[Bradford]] with no safety tests. It had these effects:
- Superhuman strength, speed, and reasoning
- Ability to heal 60480x faster / immortality
- Overwhelming hyperawareness / impatience
- Overproduction of hormones (cortisol, adrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, and testosterone)
- Overgrowth of finger bones and nails, leading to growth of claws.
- Inability to age, exhaust, sleep, feel hungry, or feel thirsty
- Pulling too much from [[Caldwell's Field]] without precision, causing fiery wounds and healing.
This test taught them a lot about [[Incarnadine Gate]]s. Initially, they believed the muscle to be controlled by thought, but it was primarily triggered by subconscious stimuli and instinct. In other words, it amplifies the abilities and effects of the feelings, and instincts of the user. The initiative sought their own Faux [[Incarnadine Gate]], but it'd take time, and [[Nethrium]], a resource they didn't have much of.

In 12000, they begin testing their own [[incarnadine gate]] on certain materials, plants, animals, and children. One of which was a 6 year old lion named [[Copper (PC)]]. They tested him in the standard initiative for months, and when he proved capable, they gave him an [[incarnadine gate]]. His [[incarnadine gate]] was unique, as it was triggered by art and music semi-consistently. They planned to execute him regardless to get the [[Nethrium]] back. He was saved by an employee and dumped into the real world. 

In 12024 (today), they're running a strict regime that's on a 5 year loop that started in 12000. In other words, they're one year from iteration 5. Every iteration, they get a new batch of about 100-150 kids ages 7-12 from across [[the galaxy]]. The first year is spent on brainwashing, experimentation, conditioning, and training. Then, at the end of the year, they're given their faux [[incarnadine gate]]. Their connection to the gate and their subsequent abilities are testing for 4 years. Then, to recollect the [[Nethrium]], they vaporize the subjects and boil everything off until nothing but the [[Nethrium]] remains. Then, they repeat.
