![[The Federation.png]]

In 6680, the nations of earth combined into one central force following WWXI. They represent and oversee all human governments with absolute control. 

In 7070, two unknown aliens land on earth. The Federation quickly apprehended and interrogated them. They inform humans that they're the bottom of the food chain, and that [[the galaxy]] is teeming with advanced, dangerous life. They hijack their ships and kill the aliens. Out of fear, they greenlight the [[Armstrong Initiative]] to make humans genetically superior to their alien counterparts.

### Rules and Regulations
- All orbital bodies within the classical human solar system (including but not limited to: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Ceres, [[Pluto]], Haumea, Makemake, Eris, and all of their subsequent moons) are under the control of the Federation and their representatives. 
- The Federation represents the collective ruling of humankind, therefore it is of the utmost importance that all legal, pure-blooded humans living in Federation territory must fill out their annual surveys. Failure to comply will result in legal action, and or deportation, as this data provides the backbone of their decision making process. 
- If a resident of a Federation owned territory passes away and they don't have an inheritance established, their belongings will be repossessed by the Federation. Legal entities cannot be inherited. 
- Houses are families that have contracts with the Federation that allow them to flex their rulings under certain circumstances. They're typically in control of large businesses, religions, empires, or other groups with large influence. This contract allows you establish an inheritance of a complex legal entity, manage and own territory as an extension of the Federation instead of directly under them, etc. 
- Additional human ruled planets, space stations, orbital bodies, etc. must be declared as houses according to their structure of government to act as extensions of the Federation, and to receive Federation funding and support. 
- Governments on house controlled human bodies are free to create and enforce their own Governments in compliance with Federation rulings. Failure to comply will result in losing Federation support, or in extreme cases, military intervention.
