![[The Federation.png]]

In 6680, the nations of earth combined into one central force following WWXI. They represent and oversee all human governments with absolute control. 

In 7070, two unknown aliens land on earth. The Federation quickly apprehended and interrogated them. They inform humans that they're the bottom of the food chain, and that the galaxy is teeming with advanced, dangerous life. They hijack their ships and kill the aliens. Out of fear, they greenlight the [[Armstrong Initiative]] to make humans genetically superior to their alien counterparts.
