They're observed by the Yakuza while gambling, stocking up on supplies, and exploring the city. While attempting to buy a ship, the hangar is attacked by the Yakuza, and their ship is trashed. They battle the Yakuza and win, and design their own ship. They return to the city while it's being fabricated. Then, [[Gemini (PC)]] and [[Taure (PC)]] shoot, mutilate, bisect, crush, and disembowel the entire family of a gun store owner, including the father ([[Dale Borland]]), the 7 year old son, the pregnant mother, and her newborn. [[Corvus (PC)]] did nothing to stop them.
