[[Pluto]] discovers the [[Armstrong Initiative]], and the [[Tessali]], and derails the plan to free the captives and burn the building down.

10064: [[Pluto]] built a small cabin in [[The Deadwoods]] where he's been protecting the [[Tessali]] and the [[Nethrium]]. One of [[House Galling]]'s bounty hunters finds and nearly kills him.

[[Outline 0]]: [[Gemini (PC)]], [[Corvus (PC)]], [[Copper (PC)]], and [[Taure (PC)]], get hired by [[House Galling]] as "general purpose assistants". They were hired to look for [[Pluto]]'s treasure, and [[Nethrium]], but they weren't told this. They find [[Pluto's Cottage]], and a note from [[Pluto]] informing them of his trials. They lie to [[House Galling]] and say they didn't find anything.
