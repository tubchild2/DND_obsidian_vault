An alternative to spellcasting for the campaign. The names and effects of the spells remain in-tact. They're renamed to spins, because in-universe, you spin the [[Caldwell's Field|Ether]] to produce matter and energy according to your thoughts. A consequence of this is that spells no longer belong to an individual class. If it exists, you want to do it, and your character has the means to do it (flavoring aside), you can do it. 

They can be accessed from the player's handbook. 

See [[Caldwell's Field]] for information on [[Caldwell's Field|Ether]].
