An alternative to spellcasting for the campaign. The names and effects of the spells remain in-tact. They're renamed to spins, because in-universe, you spin the matter and energy given to you via [[Caldwell's field]]. A consequence of this is that spells no longer belong to an individual class. If it exists, and your character has the means to do it (flavoring aside), you can do it. 

They can be accessed from the player's handbook.
