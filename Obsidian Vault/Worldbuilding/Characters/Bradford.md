### Background:
Born in the year 10000 in the city of [[Vivere Mori]], he was meant to usher in the new age of life. Born into [[house galling]], he was spoiled for choice when it came to, well... everything! His parents quickly introduced him to the [[Doctrine of St. Galling]], the religion they subscribed to. They were regular as a family, and by the time he was 10 he made friends with Emily and Timothy Peterson. The three of them were inseparable. As they grew older, Bradford started to stagnate. Bradford was immature, impulsive, and frequently aggressive towards his peers. At age 10, he was caught hitting his dog for stealing his food.  

Timothy Peterson was a bright and noble soul, who was a favorite of his dad's. He was a bit older than Bradford, and had been in the family business for awhile, and had proven himself better than Bradford. Noting this, Bradford's father Simeon mentioned that he wanted to make Timothy heir to the House instead of Bradford. Bradford and his father had an already volatile relationship, but this was different. This hurt Bradford. Bradford receded to his room, refusing to speak to his father for months. He began journaling about his lack of satisfaction with his life, and how he doesn't understand the people around him. His acts of kindness are seen as rude, he can't hold a conversation, and no girls his age look at him anymore. Even Emily and Timothy started acting quiet around him, and even called him creepy. 

Bradford then finally spoke with his father, who forced the conversation onto him. Simeon explained that Bradford wasn't chosen because he lacked the maturity, and because it wouldn't look good for the growing empire. Bradford was furious, because it was his birthright his father had revoked. On the first day of 10018 (coincidentally Bradford's birthday), Simeon would announce his heir, as he was getting old. It was only a few days away, and Bradford began journaling away about how much he despises his father. He started to develop an obsession with certain aspects of the [[Doctrine of St. Galling]]. He believed that punishing those beneath him was the will of God, as he was bringing people closer to what God had predetermined. This view that violence was him acting on the will of God, began to fester in him. 

Bradford investigated into the doings of Simeon, and learned of the [[Armstrong Initiative]]. His mother didn't even know about that, and it was much worse than he thought. He entered the hidden basement during the night, and read up on everything the initiative had been doing. Disgusted, he began scheming of ways to punish his father. He killed their dog, lightly poisoned Simeon's tea, and anonymously informed his mother about the [[Armstrong Initiative]]. It wasn't enough.  

On new year's eve of 10018, Bradford decided to act. He deserved to be Patriarch, not Timothy! His father needed to be executed. It was the will of God! Bradford was one of the most pure and devoted members of the church, surely HE knew what he was doing! He snuck into the bedroom of his father while he was sleeping, and began to choke his father. His mother woke up, and in the struggle, he ended up killing both of them. 

With them out of the picture, Bradford was declared the rightful heir, and given power over the entire house. Bradford saw this as a reward for his good deeds. He felt nothing, and didn't grieve their death. On the first of 10018, he threw himself a grand celebration. To his surprise, Timothy showed up alone. He didn't speak to Bradford the whole night, but instead stared at him. After everyone leaves, Timothy confronts Bradford. Simeon had told Timothy about his right to rule, and Bradford's lack of shock about the situation just proved to Timothy what he always knew, Bradford was a psychopath, who didn't deserve the love his father gave him. Bradford was speechless. That night, he stared into the fireplace, and contemplated hurting Timothy. He favored not to, since he had begun to develop feelings for Emily. If he killed Timothy, he'd give up his only method of bargaining! 

Bradford ordered that Emily meet him at a restaurant in upper [[Vivere Mori]]. She did, and over dinner he calmly informed her of their engagement. She rejected the notion, but before she could leave, he told her that Timothy had slandered a Judge, and it wouldn't bother his conscience to have him put down. She was horrified by this turn. She began to cry, before telling Bradford that it doesn't matter what he tells himself, he wouldn't have cared regardless of what Timothy said. Bradford said that was baseless, and that he'd pardon her transgression if she married him. Otherwise, she would be executed too. 

The two are married in mid 10018. Timothy never understood their marriage, but he was respectful of her choices, despite being suspicious. After the wedding, Timothy's curiosity got the better of him, and he read Emily's diary. Reading about what happened, he slammed the book down and went to confront Bradford. It was late at night, and Bradford was sitting near the fireplace in his robes. Timothy demanded Emily leave, and Bradford allowed it. Timothy then said he knew everything. Bradford questioned why on earth Timothy would tell him this, before calling the guards. Timothy then shot Bradford in the lung, before spending Bradford's "last waking minutes" to inject him with a carcinogen (just in case), and personally beat him to death. The guards apprehended Timothy and threw him into the [[Armstrong Initiative]] as a subject. Emily was told that Timothy had died in the confrontation. Bradford barely survived the attack and was placed in intensive care for a month. Once recovered, Bradford visited Timothy in prison and mocked his feeble attempt at killing someone with God on their side. Bradford then personally promised that he'd kill Timothy's entire family in the same way Timothy attempted. Timothy punched Bradford through the bars, so Bradford shot his leg off. He made sure Timothy got the medical care he needed. Bradford did exactly what he promised, wiping out the entire Peterson bloodline. He convinced himself that it was God's plan, which made his actions acceptable. After a few more months of playing with Timothy, Bradford shot him again, and beat him to death. Emily knew Bradford was responsible for her family's death but was currently pregnant, so it'd have to wait. 

In 10020, Bradford learned about the [[Incarnadine Gate]]s through the [[Armstrong Initiative]], something Bradford was currently using as a private and personal way to punish people he saw as sinners. He believed [[Caldwell's Field]] was the summit (heaven). He then had a dream about the rapture, and believed it was divine intervention. His interest in the rapture had followed him his whole life, but now he sought a means to make it a reality. He believed that if he were to open a large enough portal to the summit, he could bring about the rapture as a divine favor to God. The [[Armstrong Initiative]] didn't believe in that, but they did want to create a sustainable infinite power source, and believed this to be a means to do that. Together, they designed the [[Mano di Dio]], a machine designed to open a sustainable portal to [[Caldwell's Field]] if sustainably powered / superheated.
Also in 10020, Bradford's son is born. He's named Lars Galling. 

In 10024, [[Mano di Dio]] is completed. Furious with Bradford, Emily contacts a space pirate named [[Pluto]]. She gave him insider information about the guard rotations, maps of the manor, where the statue would be, all of the specifications about the defense systems, and more. She made it very clear that they should steal it, and showed them everything they needed to know to do it. Emily convinced her husband to do an exhibition of the statue as a publicity stunt, to show off their extreme wealth. Bradford agreed, and the statue was put on display exactly how she planned. During the heist, Bradford finds the [[Tessali]], and the [[Armstrong Initiative]]. Confused and enraged, he burns the whole place down. The heist devolves into a shootout, and [[Pluto]] makes it out with the [[Tessali]] and [[Mano di Dio]] (something they can't replicate without the [[Tessali]]). 
Enraged, Bradford kills everyone who was present at the event, criminal or no. He then confronts Emily, since the crew gave her up immediately. She admits everything, tells him that she found out about Timothy, and about her family, and about his father, and that she was tired of it. Bradford immediately shoots her, but she dies satisfied with the ruin she brought on [[House Galling]]. 
The situation begins to really set in, about how much power they had just lost. The [[Tessali]] was private knowledge, so people were bound to be curious where the [[Nethrium]] was coming from, and where the source had gone. Bradford hunted [[Pluto]] with everything he had, and had his family shot. He was never found.

By 10030, Lars was starting to despise his father. Lars Galling was completely neglected, and essentially raised by the maids. He catches Bradford doing drugs, so Bradford throws him in a well. Bradford has no issue with this, as Lars reminded him of Emily anyways. His lack of human connection and regular impulsive violence is getting to him, and he's no longer capable of handling himself. He's having regular mental breakdowns, can't socialize normally, and feels immense hatred for people with less money than him thanks to [[Pluto]]. He doesn't understand why his life is so unfulfilling. He begins having genocidal thoughts. His influence has decreased significantly since the house lost the [[Nethrium]], and his reputation is at an all time low. He's still immensely wealthy, but it's nothing compared to the power they missed out on without the [[Tessali]]. If he got his hands on it, he could do much more than start the rapture. Him and the [[Armstrong Initiative]] could do things people of past only dreamed of. He was born to usher in a new era, maybe this was his destiny! He was gifted with an affinity for making tough decisions, and maybe God wanted him to have this power, but his wife interfered. He would dedicate his life to finding it. 

By 10065, he's an old man. He spent his life combing [[the galaxy]] for the treasure to no avail. The little amount of [[Nethrium]] they had left was in the hands of the [[Armstrong Initiative]]. To his surprise, they had made a new discovery! Their research into incarnadine gates meant they might be able to give Bradford his youth back. He forces them to create the N53v13 formula to give himself real [[Tessali]] genes, despite it not being safe or ready. This amplifies his condition tenfold, and his mental state deteriorates to a new low. He becomes a sadistic, masochistic, pyromaniac, psychopath. His mood is completely unpredictable, and you never know what'll push him over the edge. He has an intense love for the basic pleasures of man, including money, power, vanity, lust, and of course, himself. He's a complete creep, and has no respect for anyone but himself. His inflated narcissistic tendencies allow him to justify way more wrongdoing on a ridiculous scale. It's at this specific point that Bradford begins allowing genocides.

### Personality:
Bradford is an animalistic, indulgent, impulsive, self-apologizing, bipolar, sadistic, masochist and pyromaniac, embodying the darkest aspects of human nature. Immortal and an absolute creep, he believes every power and privilege he possesses is divinely deserved. Psychopathically devoted to [[House Galling]], he views himself as a virtuous hero—a religious zealot, chosen by God, convinced that his primal instincts were amplified for a divine purpose. Despite his immense strength and immortality, Bradford is too egotistical to ever doubt himself or his actions. His unshakable conviction blinds him to his own monstrosity, and his inability to reflect on his sins only fuels his delusion of righteousness.
