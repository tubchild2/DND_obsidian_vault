### Background
- He was born in 10000
- In 10010, Emily and Ryan Peterson befriend a young Bradford. Bradford really likes both of them.
- In 10018, Simeon Galling is on his deathbed. Noting how sociopathic his son [[Bradford]] was, he elected to give his position as family patriarch to his nephew instead. His nephew (Timothy Galling) was 9 years old at the time. After learning this, [[Bradford]] entered their home at night, and strangled him. He then beat his entire family to death. He then went and poisoned his father, before altering his will to make himself the heir once more. 
- In 10019, Bradford forces Emily to marry him by threatening to hurt her. She goes along with it, and the two get married. Ryan then finds out about what Bradford did, and gets into an argument with him. Bradford hits him, and Ryan leaves. Bradford then injects him with a potent carcinogen while he's sleeping to ensure he dies a slow death. He then dives very deep into the [[Doctrine of St. Galling]] to rationalize his actions. This is when he gets the "judge" title, and loses all remorse for anything he does. His faith is unshakable. 
- In 10020, he first learned about the [[Incarnadine Gate]], and about [[Caldwell's Field]]. He believed the Field to be The Summit (a teaching of the [[Doctrine of St. Galling]]). He had a dream that night about the Rapture, and believed it to be divine prophecy. He invested 404 billion dollars worth of [[Nethrium]] (almost the entire [[Nethrium]] supply of [[House Galling]]), into a statue meant for boiling called [[Mano di Dio]]. Due to him hating his life, he wants desperately to reset the world. He thinks doing this will let him make friends, that it'll please god since the dream was apparently "God's will", let him have an enduring legacy, and let him cleanse the world with God. He's completely wrong of course, because he's a narcissistic psychopath. 
- In 10021, he changed his name from "Bradford Simeon Galling" to "Bradford Simeon Emmanuel Victor Sanctus Aurelius Galling I."
- In 10024, the statue was finished, then immediately stolen by [[Pluto]] during it's exhibition. Enraged, Bradford strangles [[Pluto]]'s friends and family. Later this year, Ryan dies of cancer, and his wife gives birth to Lars Galling. Bradford cheats on her, and Emily threatens divorce, but Bradford threatens to hurt her family so she stops. 
- In 10035, Lars Galling is 11 years old. He disrespects his father after catching him with another woman. Bradford then throws him in a well, and tells Emily everything. Emily commits die, and is no longer in the picture. Enraged, Bradford buries her parents alive. He then eats his own dog, since it reminds him of his wife and son. 
- In 10041, Bradford kills all of the subjects in the [[Armstrong Initiative]] out of boredom. Most of them were kids. At this point, he's having regular mental breakdowns, can't handle his grief, hates his life but is too narcissistic to understand why, can no longer socialize normally, and feels extremely lonely. 
- By 10065, Bradford had done a lot more, and it's so awful that I can't fathom writing it here. He's an older man now, and he's losing his energy. When he learns that the [[Incarnadine gate]] research might give him his youth back, he forces them to create the N53v13, despite it not being safe or ready. After this, his mental state deteriorates even more. He becomes a sadistic, masochistic, pyromaniac, psychopath. He becomes terrifying to be around since he's more than willing to do evil, but due to his mood being so unpredictable, you never know what's going to push him over the edge. He develops his intense love for money, power, vanity, lust, and himself. Finally, he becomes a complete creep.
- In 11970, Bradford begins enacting genocides and wars against weaker races and empires to gain land, framing it as a holy war. 
- In 12024 (Today), Judge Bradford Galling wants to find [[Pluto]]'s treasure for multiple reasons:
	1. Financial: Finding the [[Tessali]] would mean finding infinite money for his house. 
	2. Religious: [[Mano di Dio]] / lack of [[Nethrium]] is the one thing keeping Bradford from opening a portal to the summit, which he believes to be God's will. 
	3. Political: A failure like this would damage his reputation, and impact his position on the hierarchy. 
	4. Personal: He hates [[Pluto]] and wants his search to be over. 
	5. Personal: Infinite [[Nethrium]] means infinite fuel for the [[Armstrong Initiative]]. Fuel for the [[Armstrong Initiative]] means more power for him. 
	6. Personal: This treasure represents the one method he knows of the make people good enough to like him. He desperately wants real social connections, but sees no other way to get it other than purifying the earth with God. 
### Appearance:
- Tall for a human (6'5")
- Pale
- Unpleasant facial features
- His healing factor overcompensates with heat, energy, and of course the genetic material needed to reconstruct his body. This effect makes his veins glow red.
- His eyes turn red whenever he enters combat or a heightened emotional state.
- Wears an elegant outfit not meant for combat. It offers no assistance in combat, because he doesn't need it. 
### Personality:
Bradford is a self-apologizing bipolar masochist and pyromaniac, embodying the darkest aspects of human nature. Immortal and an absolute creep, he believes every power and privilege he possesses is divinely deserved. Psychopathically devoted to [[House Galling]], he views himself as a virtuous heroâ€”a religious zealot, chosen by God, convinced that his primal instincts were amplified for a divine purpose. Despite his immense strength and immortality, Bradford is too egotistical to ever doubt himself or his actions. His unshakable conviction blinds him to his own monstrosity, and his inability to reflect on his sins only fuels his delusion of righteousness. 

He's psychopathic, narcissistic, and animalistic. Though intelligent, his emotions completely drive him. He's unpredictable in that way, and completely hateable. He also exempts himself of all guilt by warping his religion to make himself out to be a hero. 

Draws inspiration from Judge Claude Frollo. "It's not my fault if it's God's plan. He made the devil so much stronger than a man."
Draws inspiration from Homelander. Intimidating, narcissistic, and unpredictable. 
Draws inspiration from Prince Commodus. Doesn't deserve what he has, is generally hateable. 

### Abilities:
- N53v13 Regeneration. Gains 10HP every 6 seconds. Healing restores youth. Will be brought back from the dead unless the [[incarnadine gate]] was disabled by electricity during his death.

- N53v13 Claws. 5ft range melee attack for 1d4 + STR. Claws take 12 seconds to regrow. 
- N53v13 Hyperawareness. All perception checks become a DC1. 
- N53v13 Electrical Vulnerability. If tasered 2-3 times, or electrocuted, he survives, but loses all of his N53v13 abilities until his next long rest. 
- Primal Rage. 
	- Resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
	- Any attacks using strength deal +2
	- Advantage on strength checks and strength saving throws
	- Disadvantage on wisdom and intelligence checks.
	- Unlike normal rage, Bradford stays enraged indefinitely and doesn't tire out.
