# Abilities
Grows an [[incarnadine gate]] (it's actually the only creature to do this by default). The gate gives it many interesting abilities.
- Can manipulate it's shape and size by moving parts of itself through the 4th dimension. 
- Can grow [[Nethrium]] by packing it's organic materials across the 4th dimension, making them impossibly dense. 
- Can interact with 4th dimensional materials as if they were 3D. 
- Can grow all of it's vital organs outside of our tangible reality. 
- Immortal, as it can heal extremely well and it's body is incomprehensible.
- Has no traditional senses, and cannot speak. BUT, it has an extremely powerful 6th sense, and has telepathic abilities.

# Other Traits
- Marked with "TESSALI" on it's arms.
- Well over 20000 years old
- Needs to sleep for 100 years every few millennia. 

# History
- Bioengineered by some advanced group of scientists far in the future. It somehow travelled back in time, and has existed here since then. It refuses to explain where it came from, since "that future doesn't exist anymore."
