# Abilities
Grows an [[incarnadine gate]] (it's actually the only creature to do this by default). The gate gives it many interesting abilities.
- Can manipulate it's shape and size by moving parts of itself through the 4th dimension. 
- Can grow [[Nethrium]] by packing it's organic materials across the 4th dimension, making them impossibly dense. 
- Can interact with 4th dimensional materials as if they were 3D. 
- Can grow all of it's vital organs outside of our tangible reality. 
- Immortal?
- Has no traditional senses, and cannot speak. BUT, it has an extremely powerful 6th sense, and has telepathic abilities.
- Has basic intelligence, akin to that of a child. Has an intense desire to observe [[the galaxy]] and nothing else. Is in immense wonder of everything around him. Content with observing anything, even if it seems uninteresting. It'll find a way to make it wonderous. It does want to travel though. 

# Other Traits
- Impossibly old
- Does nothing with its time but tour [[the galaxy]], and observe stuff. 

# History
- The only known avatar to ever exist. It's the avatar of the [[Primordial]] of observation, which is in a bad spot, since it's too complex to be powerful, and too ancient to be really intelligent. Due to some luck, it managed to make an avatar. 
- It wasn't hostile, and just kind of flew around until being discovered and captured by [[House Galling]]. 
- It was tortured until 10024, where [[Pluto]] found and rescued it. Exhausted and thoroughly wounded, it was essentially braindead. [[Pluto]] had to keep its barely functional body hidden with the rest of the treasure he stole. 
- By 12024, it's starting to regain consciousness, but is still weak.
