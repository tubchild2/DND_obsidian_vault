### Background:
He was born in [[Manor Galling]] in 10000. He was the rightful heir to [[House Galling]], and he was quickly taught the teachings of the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|DSG]] church. When he was 10, he befriended Emily and Timothy Peterson. As they matured, Bradford didn't. He was immature, impulsive, and frequently aggressive toward his peers. He hit his own dog for stealing his food. 

Timothy Peterson was a noble man, and the preferred heir according to Patriarch Simeon Galling. Timothy had been in the church longer, and he had shown to be much more responsible. Bradford was incredibly hurt by this, and this shattered the already volatile relationship between Bradford and Simeon. The two refused to speak to one another. Bradford retreated to journaling and the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|DSG]] to understand his situation. His acts of kindness are seen as rude, he doesn't understand anyone around him, and no women look at him anymore. Even Emily and Timothy are quieter around him than normal. 

On the first day of 10018, Simeon would announce his heir to the world. It was only a few days away, so Bradford once again retreated to his journal, and to the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|DSG]]. He became obsessed with certain aspects of the religion, and started to believe that an act of violence against his father was what he needed to move up in the world, and was therefore the will of God. He then discovered the [[Armstrong Initiative]] beneath his home. He snuck in and read up on everything they'd been doing. He was disgusted and knew his father needed to be punished, but he didn't know if it was his responsibility. He needed to work his way up, so he messed with his parents marriage, lightly poisoned his father's tea, and killed his dog. He wasn't punished, which (to him) meant that God was guiding him!

On new year's eve of 10018, Bradford decided to act. His father needed to be executed. It was the will of God! Bradford was one of the most pure and devoted members of the church, surely HE knew what he was doing! He snuck into the bedroom of his father while he was sleeping, and began to choke his father. His mother woke up, and in the struggle, he ended up killing both of them. With them out of the picture, Bradford was declared the rightful heir, and given power over the entire house. Bradford saw this as a reward, felt nothing, and didn't grieve their death.

On the first of 10018, he threw himself a grand celebration. To his surprise, Timothy showed up alone. He didn't speak to Bradford the whole night, but instead stared at him. After everyone left, Timothy confronted Bradford. Simeon had told Timothy about his right to rule, and Bradford's response to their passing told Timothy everything he needed to know, so he left without speaking to anyone. That night, Bradford stared into the fireplace, and contemplated hurting Timothy. He favored not to, since he had begun to develop feelings for Emily. If he killed Timothy, he'd give up his only method of bargaining. 

Bradford had Emily meet him at a restaurant in upper [[Vivere Mori]]. She did, and over dinner he calmly informed her of their engagement. She rejected the notion, but before she could leave, he told her that Timothy had slandered the patriarch, and it wouldn't bother his conscience to have him put down. She was horrified. She told Bradford that he could lie to himself, and believe he deserved what he had, and that he had an ounce of understanding what God wanted, but he couldn't lie to her. She accepted the marriage.

The two were married in mid 10018. The wedding is fancy and elaborate, but what happens afterwards if far from it. Bradford is a really bad person, let's just leave it at that. Timothy never understood their marriage, but he was respectful of her choices, despite being suspicious. After the wedding, Timothy's curiosity got the better of him, and he read Emily's diary. Reading about what happened, he slammed the book down and went to confront Bradford. It was late at night, and Bradford was sitting near the fireplace in his robes. Timothy demanded Emily leave, and Bradford allowed it. Timothy then said he knew everything. Bradford questioned why on earth Timothy would tell him this, before summoning two inquisitors. Timothy then shot Bradford in the lung, before spending Bradford's "last waking minutes" to inject him with a carcinogen (just in case), and personally beat him to death. The inquisitors apprehended Timothy and threw him into the [[Armstrong Initiative]] as a test subject. Emily was told that Timothy had died in the confrontation, while Bradford was placed in intensive care for a month. Once recovered, Bradford visited Timothy in prison and mocked his feeble attempt at killing someone with God on their side. Bradford then personally promised that he'd kill Timothy's entire family in the same way Timothy attempted. Timothy punched Bradford through the bars, so Bradford shot his leg off. He made sure Timothy got the medical care he needed. Bradford did exactly what he promised, wiping out the entire Peterson bloodline. After a few more months of playing with Timothy, Bradford shot him again, and beat him to death. Emily knew Bradford was responsible for her family's death but was currently pregnant, so it'd have to wait. 

In 10020, Bradford learned about the [[Incarnadine Gate]]s through the [[Armstrong Initiative]], something Bradford was currently using as a private and personal way to punish people he saw as sinners. During one test they attempted to send signals into [[Caldwell's Field]] by barely bringing a couple grams of [[Nethrium]] to a boil. Patriarch [[Bradford]] Galling was called in to observe, and during the experiment, he had an intense encounter with the [[Primordial]] of the Wild. It made him an envoy, and convinced him that he was the God that he worshiped. The [[Primordial]] then told him that he needed to open a larger gate to cause the rapture (a [[Doctrine of St. Galling|DSG]] Church teaching). It made him an envoy, giving him an intense desire to do this, and an animalistic dark side that's difficult to contain behind his public persona of charity and righteousness. After convening with the keeper and his cardinals, [[Bradford]] approves the development of a 6ft [[Nethrium]] statue designed by the [[Armstrong Initiative]] to be optimally superheated and boiled. He calls it the "[[Mano di Dio]]." It'd cost nearly all of their [[Nethrium]] to build it, and it'd take multiple years, but it'd be worth it. 

In 10024, [[Mano di Dio]] is completed. Furious with Bradford, Emily contacts a space pirate named [[Pluto]]. She gave him insider information about the guard rotations, maps of the manor, where the [[Mano di Dio]] would be, all of the specifications about the defense systems, and more. She made it very clear that they should steal it, and showed them everything they needed to know to do it. Emily convinced her husband to do an exhibition of the statue as a publicity stunt. 
Bradford agreed, and the statue was put on display exactly how she planned. During the heist, [[Pluto]] found the [[Tessali]], and the [[Armstrong Initiative]]. Confused and enraged, he burns the whole place down. The heist devolves into a shootout, and [[Pluto]] makes it out with the [[Tessali]] and [[Mano di Dio]] (something they can't replicate without the [[Tessali]]) despite knowing nothing about their true nature. 

[[Bradford]] has [[Pluto]]'s friends and family executed, and anyone present during the heist (including his own men) are shot. He then relentlessly pursues [[Pluto]] with an army of bounty hunters, but to avail.

By 10065, Bradford is an old man. He spent his life combing [[the galaxy]] for the treasure to no avail. The small amount of [[Nethrium]] they had left was in the hands of the [[Armstrong Initiative]]. To his surprise, they had made a new discovery! Their research into [[Incarnadine Gate|incarnadine gates]] meant they might be able to give Bradford his youth back. He forces them to create the N53v13 formula to give himself real [[Tessali]] genes, despite it not being safe or ready. He was already an animalistic person with little understanding of or care for anything beyond the most basic pleasures of life. However, after becoming an envoy of the wild, and after getting the N53v13 serum, his condition amplified tenfold, and his mental state deteriorated to a new low. 

Modern day: His public persona is that of an experienced and intelligent leader for [[House Galling]] and for the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|DSG]] church. In reality, he's a horrific, indulgent, self-apologizing, sadistic, masochistic, pyromaniac who embodies all of the worst instincts of human nature. He believes everything he has is a gift from God, and that everything he does is likewise the will of God. He's obsessed with building the gate due to becoming an envoy, and his serum makes him stuck in an endless loop, combing [[the galaxy]] for it.
