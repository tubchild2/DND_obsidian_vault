### Lore and Roleplay
**Personality**
- **Zealot**. Must do what [[Primordial of Command|Tod]] tells him, even if he doesn't want to.
- **Reclusive.** Isn't socially gifted, and instead prefers to study.
- **Detached.** Isn't interested in politics. He relies mostly on the Keeper and the Cardinals of the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] to make decisions for [[House Galling]]. When it comes to the [[Mano di Dio]], he delegates under the advice of [[Primordial of Command|Tod]]. He only gets his hands dirty if he has to. 
- **Deceived.** Believes he's regularly communicating with god. Whatever it tells him to do, he believes is justified.
- **Reasonable.** Is open to negotiation, and doesn't enjoy harming people.
- **Bored.** Doesn't have any new experiences. Knows pretty much everything about everything, and has done pretty much everything. Has spent millennia combing [[the galaxy]] for a statue, and its been agonizing. 

**Backstory**
10000
	Born in [[Manor Galling]] as the rightful heir to [[House Galling]]. Quickly taught the teachings of the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]]. He didn't do well socially, and lacked good leadership skills. He was weak, lonely, and embarrassed. 
10018
	Simeon Galling (his father) died of old age, and he took up the mantle of Patriarch. He wasn't liked by the public, and was frequently harassed due to being a rich kid, an inexperienced leader, and the representative of [[House Galling]] and the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]], which both have an awful reputation. 
	He needed to marry someone and have kids per his responsibility as Patriarch, so he married Emily Peterson, someone he knew when he was a kid. 
	He wanted to shut down the [[Armstrong Initiative]], but the Keeper of the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] convinced him to keep it open. 
10020
	He was called to the [[Armstrong Initiative]] to represent [[House Galling]]. They detected intelligent thought through high velocity [[Nethrium]]. He thought it sounded like a waste of time, but it was his responsibility. He then had an encounter with the [[Primordial of Command]]--[[Primordial of Command|Tod]].
	[[Primordial of Command|Tod]] convinced Bradford that he was god, and kept his true nature hidden. [[Primordial of Command|Tod]] then set up a deal. If Bradford would accomplish a few things for him, then [[Primordial of Command|Tod]] would give him immortality, respect, and power. All Bradford would need to do is build a large [[Caldwell's Field|gateway]]. [[Primordial of Command|Tod]] elaborated, that (as god) he had the power to bring about the rapture, but he'd only do it once Bradford built the [[Caldwell's Field|gateway]]. Thus, if Bradford didn't do it, he'd be prolonging the suffering of the innocent. Bradford accepted this deal, and a piece of paired [[Caldwell's Field|Eathyst]] formed in his head. 
	Bradford immediately made plans with the [[Armstrong Initiative]], and the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] to commission a large [[Nethrium]] statue to open a larger [[Caldwell's Field|gateway]]. They agreed, and he spent nearly all of their [[Nethrium]] on building the statue, which was later named the [[Mano di Dio]].
10024
- By this point, Bradford had gotten much more than he bargained for. He wasn't respected, he was feared. The [[Caldwell's Field|primordial]] was having him commit violent acts on innocent people, framing them as "justice." 
- Emily found out about the [[Armstrong Initiative]]'s experiments on children, and their most recent plans. Knowing it'd be impossible to replace, Emily wanted to dispose of it, but she couldn't do it herself. She convinced Bradford to do a public display of the [[Mano di Dio]] for PR, giving someone an opportunity to steal it.
- Emily then contacted a space pirate named [[Pluto]]. She gave him insider information about the guard rotations, maps of the manor, where the [[Mano di Dio]] would be, all of the specifications about the defense systems, and more. She made it very clear that they should steal it, and showed them everything they needed to know to do it. 
- During the heist, [[Pluto]] found the [[Tessali]], and the [[Armstrong Initiative]]. Confused and enraged, he burned [[Manor Galling]] down. The heist devolved into a shootout, and [[Pluto]] made it out with the [[Tessali]] and [[Mano di Dio]] (something they can't replicate without the [[Tessali]]) despite knowing nothing about their true nature. Emily is shot during the conflict.
- Enraged, [[Primordial of Command|Tod]] has Bradford execute everyone present, including his own men. [[Primordial of Command|Tod]] then orders Bradford to pursue [[Pluto]]. They find nothing, so [[Primordial of Command|Tod]] has Bradford kill [[Pluto]]'s friends and family. He then relentlessly pursues [[Pluto]] with an army of bounty hunters and [[inquisitors]], but to no avail. 
12024
	Bradford has spent 2000 years combing [[the galaxy]] for the [[Tessali]] and [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]], all for [[Primordial of Command|Tod]]. He's done many unspeakable acts in his name, and it's been an agonizing, slow, tedious crawl. He's even more reclusive, and is neither respected nor hated. He relies heavily on other people to make decisions, and only really cares about finding the [[Mano di Dio]]. 

**Agenda**
1. Whatever the [[Caldwell's Field|primordial]] wants.
2. Find the [[Mano di Dio]].
3. Open the [[Caldwell's Field|gateway]]. 
4. Bring about the rapture ([[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] teaching), because people are counting on him.

**Appearance**
- Tall, gaunt body
- Looks like he's in his mid-30s
- Unpleasant facial features
- Wears a regal black robe
- Wears black combat boots
- Wears black leather gloves
- Has disgusting bone claws growing out of his fingertips that he hides with black leather gloves
- His eyes and veins glow red when in combat or a heightened emotional state
