**General**
A human bounty hunter known for his frequent use of [[Weapon Catalogue|smoke grenades]], and overblown sense of self-importance. 

**History**
10036
	Born aboard a [[Federation]] cruiser.
10059
	Hired by [[House Galling]] to search for [[Pluto]]. [[House Galling]] hired tens of thousands of hunters, so he wasn't unique or special.
10063
	He began to grow suspicious of [[House Galling]], so he began his own research to learn what [[Pluto]] stole. 
10064
	Aaron receives a tip that [[Pluto]]'s ship was reportedly spotted flying towards [[the Deadwoods]]. He kept this information to himself, as he wanted to keep [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]] for himself. 
	He found and engaged and older [[Pluto]] in combat. The battle was long, sloppy, and brutal. [[Pluto]] couldn't match his strength or skill, but he had much higher quality weapons at his disposal. [[Pluto]] wounded him, and then impaled him with his own sword.
