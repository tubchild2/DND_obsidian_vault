**General**
	A [[CSG and HG Soldiers|sanctumborne]], and the personal sentinel of [[Bradford|Bradford Galling]]. All of their humanity has been stripped away, and they were born from a cauldron of genetically modified organic matter. They're 9ft tall, and the product of 30 years of conditioning.
	Faster, stronger, smarter, more durable, more *everything*. On top of that, they have much more [[Caldwell's Field|Eathyst]] than even the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Templars]]. 
	Wields [[Weapon Catalogue|the warknuckle]], a 947lbs, 644 million [[Galactic Standards|credit]], [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] / [[Caldwell's Field|Eathyst]] / [[Exotic Metals|Illidium]] warhammer. 

**History**
11994
	Their genetic material was formed and perfectly assembled. After a few weeks, they were ready to begin conditioning.
12024
	They've completed conditioning, and are the first [[CSG and HG Soldiers|sanctumborne]] to ever survive the process. They're by far the strongest unit [[House Galling]] has, and so they're relegated to protecting [[Bradford]].
