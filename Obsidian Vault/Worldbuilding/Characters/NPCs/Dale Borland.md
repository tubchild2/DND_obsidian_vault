### Appearance and Personality:
He dressed in a long brown trench coat that covered his weapons, a bandana to cover the damage to his mouth, a cowboy hat to hide his eyes, and spurred boots to alert people to his presence. 

He had developed a slow, deep, southern accent. He's quiet, and doesn't talk much. He's genuinely a caring man, who refuses to harm anyone besides [[the party]]. He's still very fatherly, and cares deeply about protecting children and families. He sees no way of getting back what he lost, so he wants to avenge it before he dies. 

### Backstory (SOME HASN'T HAPPENED YET)
On September 8th 12024, [[Taure (PC)]], [[Gemini (PC)]], and [[Corvus (PC)]] entered his gun store in the city of [[Vivere Mori]]. Dale and his family were on the eccentric side, but they were happy despite their unfortunate living conditions. Dale was shot twice by [[Gemini (PC)]] and collapsed on the ground. His 7 year old son Reed was the crushed and disemboweled in front of him by [[Taure (PC)]]. Not long after, his wife Alanna was hacked to pieces by [[Gemini (PC)]]. The stress caused her to give birth to their baby girl, who was then bisected by [[Gemini (PC)]]. 

Dale was taken to a local hospital that same day and received multiple amputations without anesthesia because he couldn't afford it. He lost his arm, half his mouth, 3 of his fingers, and one of his feet. He received plastic bionic implants to replace his lost limbs, and was charged by the hospital for arrival on short notice. An overwhelming sensation of heartbreak settled over him. He mourned his son, and missed him more than anything else in the world. The two of them were going to have a movie marathon that night. He couldn't afford to pay for the hospital bill, so the hospital repossessed his home, his store, his stock, his [[overclock]] supply, and all of his cash. He spent the night in his ship and spent his time writing letters to his family, letting them know how he's doing, and things he wanted to tell them. 

From the 9th to the 13th, he sobered up, lived out of his ship, and began dwelling on the people who did this to him. He stayed up every night, and called [[House Galling]] law enforcement as soon as their office opened, but they just weren't interested in helping him more than the bare minimum. He slammed his phone down and smashed on the counter in a fit of rage. Those people ruined his life, and no one other than him seems to care. If no one else is going to try to stop them, and he has nothing to lose, then he swears he'll kill them himself in the name of his family. 

On September 14th, He began collecting parts and fabricating his own weapons out of his ship. His sobriety, focus, and expertise made him one of the most devastating weapon makers in [[The Galaxy|central plate]]. He spent all day every day honing his mind and body. After a month of rigorous discipline he had become a borderline unstoppable assassin. 

On November 19th 2025, he broke into [[House Galling]]'s military reserves and stole a cybernetic arm, which he then modified to fit his needs. He then completed crafting a deadly arsenal of customized weapons.
