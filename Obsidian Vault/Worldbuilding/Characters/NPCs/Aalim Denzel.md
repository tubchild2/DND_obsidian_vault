- **Prideful.** Doesn't like being told what to do. He's a prick.
- **Doesn't Like [[Bradford]].** [[Bradford]] wastes all his time and resources looking for [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]], and has delegated his responsibilities with the house, and with the [[Armstrong Initiative]], to him. [[Mano di Dio|The Mano di Dio]] hasn't been a productive venture in (literally) thousands of years. However, he has to do what he says. 
- **Human**. Easily tempted by mortal desires.
