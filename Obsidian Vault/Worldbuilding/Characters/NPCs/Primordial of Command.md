### General Information
A complex [[Caldwell's Field|primordial]], and their de facto leader. Tod chose his name because he likes it. His thesis is "commanding" which is incredibly nuanced, and has only gotten more complex with time.

A master of deception, strategy, planning, and organization. He delegates everything he does. Expertly used a brief opportunity to create an [[Caldwell's Field|avatar]] out of [[Bradford]] to set his plans into motion. 
Grants abilities related to creating, commanding, and empowering subordinates. 

He wants to create a gate large enough that he can exit as a [[Caldwell's Field|theophany]]. Once in our world, he plans to release all of the [[Caldwell's Field|primordials]] as [[Caldwell's Field|theophany]], and then implement a new order on [[the galaxy]], in which he's the supreme leader of everything. If he plays his cards right, he might even be able to control the [[Caldwell's Field|feeders]] that spawn.
