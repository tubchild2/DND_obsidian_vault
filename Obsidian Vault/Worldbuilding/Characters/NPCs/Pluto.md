In 10000, Pluto Winton Haywood was born in a small, lower-class village on Pluto (the planet). Though dirt poor, he aspired to become the greatest adventurer who ever lived. He wanted to be a space-pirate, a treasure hunter, and a great warrior. It's customary for males to take the planet's name and go by their middle name, but Pluto wanted a name that was simultaneously iconic and inconspicuous. That's why he decided to go by Pluto after leaving home. He still follows Plutonian customs, like paying his respects to the great moons, celebrating Plutonian new years (once every ~248 Earth years), yearly ice sculpting, and habitually keeping candles and fires burning through the night due to Plutonian winters being infamously cold and dark.

In 10024, Pluto is contacted by Emily Galling (the current patriarch's wife) with a bunch of inside information about [[House Galling]], [[Manor Galling]], their plans, and that they had spent 404 billion credits, and 98% of the [[Nethrium]] on a pointless statue named [[Mano di Dio]]. It had some silly religious explanation for existence, but Pluto knew it didn't matter. He gathered his men together, and executed the heist on [[Manor Galling]]. During the heist however, Pluto uncovered a secret basement door that wasn't in the plans. Curious, he looked around, and discovered the [[Armstrong Initiative]], as well as the barely conscious [[Tessali]] being tortured. It then finally clicked why Emily would want her own empire to fall. Enraged at the situation, he derailed the plan to try and free the [[Tessali]], and burn the [[Armstrong Initiative]] (and [[Manor Galling]]) to the ground. His men turned on him to try and get the statue out, but the uncontrollable fire quickly turned things into a firefight between them and security. Pluto escaped with the [[Tessali]], and [[Mano di Dio]], leaving his men behind to die. Pluto then retreats to his home on mars, only to find his family and friends strangled. With nothing and no one, Pluto retreats into [[the deadwoods]], and begins living off the grid in a small cabin he built ([[Pluto's Cottage]]). He aims to protect the [[Tessali]] from [[House Galling]]. Unfortunately, the [[Tessali]] is pretty much comatose after being tortured and experimented on for so long. It'd be a long time before it recovers from that. 

From 10024 - 10064, Pluto hid out at his cottage ([[Pluto's Cottage]]). But the more time he has to think about it, the less it all makes sense! Why would [[House Galling]] make such a pointlessly expensive statue? Why was it designed like that? Where did the [[Tessali]] come from, and why was it full of [[Nethrium]]? On that topic, what *is* [[nethrium]]? Is it a metal? Then why was it inside the [[Tessali]]? What type of creature *was* the [[Tessali]]? As far as Pluto could figure it didn't have any organs, just a mess of tentacles with a face. A piece of the puzzle was missing, and Pluto desperately wanted to find it. But he couldn't leave his cottage, it'd be too much of a risk.

In 10064, one of [[House Galling]]'s bounty hunters (Rayan) managed to track down [[Pluto's cottage]] in [[The Deadwoods]]. Rayan attempted to kill him, but Pluto got the upper hand and impaled him with his own sword before he could signal for help. The fight was sloppy, and brutal, and if it wasn't for dumb luck he would have lost. The [[Tessali]] was strange, and he desperately wanted to understand it. Yet, he respected it. It was clearly much more powerful than anything he'd heard of, and whatever role it played in the ecosystem was clearly beyond him. He loved that creature, but it was at this point that he realized that he couldn't trust himself to take care of it anymore. Someone would find it, so he wanted to be absolutely certain that it wasn't [[House Galling]].

Pluto set about two goals. First, constructing a set of small, intricately hidden trials to find someone worthy of taking his place as guardian of the [[Mano di Dio]], and the [[Tessali]]. Second, investigate the true nature of the [[Nethrium]], and the [[Tessali]]. He privately and securely contacted only the most trustworthy of his old accomplices, and set about using his funds to build the trials.

Pluto had a couple research buildings on a blizzardy ice planet. The snow was so intense, that you couldn't tell where the land ended and the sky began, it was all white in all directions, yet extremely foggy. About halfway through the construction of the trials, he attempted to telepathically communicate with the [[Tessali]]. During this test, he saw something that scared him so bad, that he abandoned the trials and lost his mind. His final resting place is much more elaborate, because instead of trying to test people, he was trying to keep them out. He doesn't want anyone to get the [[Tessali]] or the [[Mano di Dio]] anymore, he wants to destroy them. He lacks the technology to do so, but he can still attempt to hide them deep underground where no one will ever find them.
