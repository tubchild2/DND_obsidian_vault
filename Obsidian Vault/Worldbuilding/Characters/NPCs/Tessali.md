# History
- The [[Caldwell's Field|Primordial]] of Observation. A powerful and ancient [[Caldwell's Field|primordial]]. Was in the right place at the right time, and managed to form a [[Caldwell's Field|theophany]] out of a naturally occurring [[Caldwell's Field|gateway]]. 
- It wasn't hostile, and just flew around until being discovered and captured by [[House Galling]]. 
- It was tortured until 10024, where [[Pluto]] found and rescued it. Exhausted and thoroughly wounded, it was essentially braindead. The Tessali had expended almost all of its [[Caldwell's Field|Ether]] to produce the [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]], and it'd take a long time to completely replenish it. 
- In 12024, it's starting to regain consciousness.
