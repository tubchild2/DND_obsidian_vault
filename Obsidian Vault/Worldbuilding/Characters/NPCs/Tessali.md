# History
- The only known [[Caldwell's Field|theophany]] to ever exist. It's the [[Caldwell's Field|theophany]] of the [[Caldwell's Field|Primordial]] of observation, which is in a bad spot, since it's too complex to be powerful, and too ancient to be really intelligent. Due to some luck, it managed to make itself a body. 
- It wasn't hostile, and just flew around until being discovered and captured by [[House Galling]]. 
- It was tortured until 10024, where [[Pluto]] found and rescued it. Exhausted and thoroughly wounded, it was essentially braindead. The [[Caldwell's Field|Eathyst]] keeping the [[Caldwell's Field|Theophany]] alive was barely kicking, and it'd take thousands of years to work it's way back. [[Pluto]] had to keep its barely functional body hidden with the rest of the treasure he stole. 
- In 12024, it's starting to regain consciousness.
