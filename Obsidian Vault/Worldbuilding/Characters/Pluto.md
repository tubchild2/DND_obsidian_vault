In 10000, Pluto was born in a small, lower-class village on mars. Though dirt poor, he aspired to become the greatest adventurer who ever lived. He wanted to be a space-pirate, a treasure hunter, and a great warrior.

In 10024, Pluto began plans to be the first to crack [[House Galling]]. They had spent 404 billion credits, and 98% of their [[Nethrium]], on a pointless statue named [[Mano di Dio]]. It had some silly religious explanation for existence, but Pluto knew it didn't matter. He gathered his men together, and executed the heist on [[Manor Galling]]. During the heist however, Pluto uncovered a secret basement door that wasn't in the plans. Curious, he looked around, and discovered the [[Armstrong Initiative]], as well as the [[Tessali]] being tortured. Enraged, he derailed the plan to try and free the [[Tessali]], and burn the [[Armstrong Initiative]] (and [[Manor Galling]]) to the ground. His men turned on him to try and get the statue out, but the uncontrollable fire quickly turned things into a firefight between them and security. Pluto escaped with the [[Tessali]], and [[Mano di Dio]], leaving his men behind to die. Pluto then retreats to his home on mars, only to find his family and friends strangled. With nothing and no one, Pluto retreats into [[the deadwoods]], and begins living off the grid in a small cabin he built ([[Pluto's Cottage]]). He aims to protect the [[Tessali]] from [[House Galling]] no matter what happens. 

From 10024 - 10064, Pluto lives in his cottage ([[Pluto's Cottage]]) and tries to life a happy life off the grid with the [[Tessali]]. He slowly started to become bitter over his life, and the [[Tessali]] knew it. He couldn't even use the wealth he acquired, he was stuck caring for some random animal, and [[House Galling]] was still running the [[Armstrong Initiative]], and he couldn't do anything about it. He wanted it to be over, but he couldn't abandon the [[Tessali]]. All the while, he couldn't understand why [[Bradford]] would spend so much on a stupid statue! [[Mano di Dio]] was completely pointless! 

In 10064, one of [[House Galling]]'s bounty hunters (Rayan) managed to track down [[Pluto's cottage]] in [[The Deadwoods]]. Rayan attempted to kill him, but Pluto got the upper hand and impaled him with his own sword before he could signal for help. The fight was sloppy, and brutal, and if it wasn't for the [[Tessali]]'s intervention he would have lost. He knew he couldn't handle this responsibility anymore, so he needed to find a replacement. In his final years he created a series of trials to find someone capable of taking his place as guardian of the [[Tessali]].
