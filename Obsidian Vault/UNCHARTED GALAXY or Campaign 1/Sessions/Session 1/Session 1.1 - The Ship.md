### *Introduction to Session 1*
**GET THE MAP OF THE SHIP OUT**
- Do it or youre buig gay dudddde
**Recap**
- Welcome back!
- Does anyone want to recap in character where we left off last time? 
- Landon was just on the ship the whole time btw.
**Opening Monologue**
- The ship's florescent lights hum softly, yet a nameless dread heightening your senses makes it feel louder than ever before. You all sit silently in the worn leather seats of the cockpit, having just lied to your supervisor. A decision that would surely keep you up at night, not with regret, but with fear. The ship is currently idle on the forest planet of [[The Deadwoods]], what do you want to do?
	- (Make an error noise) As you type in the coordinates, it sets you up to fly to the planet of [[Vivimus]]. Then, you get a giant red error message saying the planet you're attempting to land on is blacklisted by [[House Galling]]. It's trying to reroute you to another spot on the planet.
	- (wait) Could I get a history check from everyone to see what you know about the planet?
**Exploration**
- The ship has many rooms:
	- Cockpit (which you're all in now)
	- Bathroom
	- Kitchen
	- Maintenance Room
	- Each of you has a cabin
	- Loading Bay

| 1              | You've never heard of that planet before.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2-5            | You vaguely remember a children's song using the winds of [[Vivimus]] as a metaphor for death, but you can't remember why.<br>You're also pretty sure [[House Galling]] has something to do with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 6-10           | You recognize the name from a training video shown to you by corporate when you signed on. The planet's surface is extremely dangerous, and you were instructed to avoid landing there on company time, as you'd more than likely die.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 11-15          | You recognize it immediately. [[Vivimus]] is one of the most volatile and dangerous planets in [[The Galaxy]]. You know it'd be extremely difficult to land on the surface in this crappy of a ship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 16-20          | You know it immediately, you've avoided this planet your whole life. [[Vivimus]] is a horrifying place. Chemical rivers, fiery parasites, earth-shattering volcanoes, toxic fog, and some of the most hostile wildlife in the known galaxy. If you landed this crappy ship on its surface, you'd be eaten alive by the time the second sun rises.<br>You also recognize [[Vivere Mori]], the city it's trying to take you to. It's protected from the forces of nature, but it's the location of [[House Galling]] HQ, and is one of the seediest, most criminal infested cities in the known galaxy. |

### *Bathroom*
The smell hits you first—a sour blend of disinfectant, rotten eggs, and [[Taure (PC)]]'s rancid craps. The cramped bathroom is a dingy shade of industrial green, with scuffed walls and a toilet that’s little more than a glorified portapotty. A faded digital display on the seat blinks: **"2 [[Galactic Standards|credits]] for 15 minutes"** in cheerful yellow letters.

On the wall, a glossy poster from **[[House Galling]]** beams down at you. It shows a cartoonish businessman giving a thumbs up with the slogan "WIPE THOROUGHLY ON COMPANY TIME."

**Perception Check (DC 13):**  
    You notice a vent cover near the ceiling on the right wall, and a faint green led light shining through it. 
    There's a camera in there pointed directly at the toilet.

### *Kitchen*
The kitchen feels like something out of a forgotten era. The cracked, dirty white tiles beneath your feet are stained with years of neglect, and the walls are smeared with greasy fingerprints. A single, flickering fluorescent light buzzes overhead, casting an eerie greenish glow across the room, while the constant hum of flies fills the air. In one corner, a vent cover hangs askew, with frayed wires spilling out. Looking around you spot a few things:
- There's a nutrient paste dispenser. 
- There are some cabinets below the sink. 
- And there's an open book on the counter. 


The [[House Galling]] brand nutrient paste dispenser. 
	There's a blinking yellow light demanding 2 [[Galactic Standards|credits]] per use. 
	(AIDEN, DO A LUCK ROLL) anything a 7 jams it, pooling paste all over the floor. Otherwise, you get some nutrient paste. 
There are some cabinets below the sink.
	Inside are some cubic cans neatly stacked into big piles. They're labeled [[House Galling]] Meat Product. You have no idea if it's edible. 
	There's also a book on mixology left behind by someone named Owen. It has a bunch of drink recipes. 
		- Plasma Pucker
		- Void's Embrace
		- Nebula Nectar
		- Titanium Sunrise
		- Lunar Eclipse
There's an open cookbook on the counter.
	It was owned by someone on the crew right before you named Kellen. It's got a whole bunch of recipes in there that you might be able to cook. Someone was just reading it. 
		- Jellyfish Pie
		- Elysian Snake Steak
		- Venusian Fire Pepper Salad
		- Deep Rock Stew
		- Fried Lithworms
		- Roasted Plutonian Corn Weevils
		- Keppler Crumble Cake

### *Maintenance Room*
You walk into a loud room packed with shelves of chemicals, tools, and different plastic bags of parts and wires thrown onto them. The ship's engine is directly front of you, emanating a fiery orange light, and an intense dry heat. The room is filled with a deafening cacophony of mechanical clanking and whirring that hurts your ears. Could I get a perception check?

| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1                 | You notice a clipboard nailed on a metal drum. The clipboard says, "if you hear whistling, smack the upper-right hand corner of the engine - Owen" |
| 6-10              | You notice a large metal drum that looks kind of damaged.                                                                                          |
| 11-15             | You notice some drag marks on the floor from a large damaged metal drum.                                                                           |
| 16-20             | You notice a vent in the floor partially obscured by a large metal drum that looks like it's been dragged.                                         |
- There's a large metal drum that's clearly been moved across the floor.
- DC10 athletics check. Moving it aside reveals a very unnatural looking vent cover. 
- Inside the vent cover is a small hidden storage compartment.
	- A group photo of the previous crew. They're all smiling, and doing a group hug. 
	- A dismantled gas mask that has a thick gash in it's forehead. 
	- There's a yellow note with rushed, red handwriting that says, "7.7.12024"



### Cockpit
A large reinforced glass window stretches in front of you, offering a view of the blinding rush of colors from faster-than-light travel. The room feels worn and neglected—dimly lit with the faint smell of rust. The leather on the chairs is peeling, and the metal surfaces are stained and rusted. A vent cover has wires spilling out of it. A clutter of machines and tools litters the space, each one showing signs of heavy use. Could I get a perception check? 
- There's a computer
	- Security systems
	- Ship records
- There's a PA system
- There's a radio
- There are the ship controls and autopilot
- DC10 There's a metal panel on the wall that looks very worn
	- You see a red button connected to a bunch of wires that's jammed in. There's a sticky note that says, "DO NOT PRESS" in a red marker. 

***Security Application (Computer)***
- The cameras have a bootup noise: ![[SecurityFootageStartup.wav]]
- (Play bootup audio now) You can enter any date from that past 2 years. 
- If they want to enter a random date: Could I get an investigation check? (See table)
	- You enter the date 9.7.12024. You see an empty ship as you're all investigating the cabin in [[The Deadwoods]]. 
	- You enter the date 9.8.12024. You see yourself on the cameras right now. 
	- (play the audio now). You enter the date 7.7.12024. This would have been around the time the last crew left. It's 2am, and almost completely dark, and there's thick static and some kind of gas pluming through the ship. You hear the wind screaming, and an inorganic thrumming in the distance. You squint your eyes and lean forward, and recognize the shapes of bodies strewn across the floor--their appendages bent and deformed. Some are sprawled out, and others are slumped against the walls. But... there's something else there. In the corner of your screen, you see a dark shape you don't understand, twitching rapidly. It begins to make an eerie, whining groan over the wet squelching of flesh, before barreling down the hallway. All the cameras go dark, but the audio is still playing. The machine grows louder and louder, closer and closer. But, then it simply stops. The rest of the footage was erased. ![[Audio Tape 7.7.12024.wav]]

| 2-5                  | You get some footage, but there doesn't seem to be anyone there. It seems they're on a mission somewhere                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 6-10                 | You see a man in an orange cap tinkering with a bunch of tools. He stands up, and begins pacing back and forth, covering his mouth and breathing heavily. The audio was disabled, but he's clearly distressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 11-15                | You recognize a man as a member of the ship's last crew. You see him in the loading bay, waiting for the rest of the group to leave. Once they do, he sprints into the maintenance room, then into the cockpit, and enters the ship's vents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 16-20                | You see a member of the ship's previous crew. There's no one else on board the ship. He crawls out of the vents holding a strange, wiry contraption. He sets it down, and pulls something out of his pocket. You can't make out the details, but he holds what looks like a vial of ink up to it. After a few seconds, it begins beeping and flashing rapidly. He starts frantically messing with it, trying to get it to turn off, but it wont. He grabs a hammer and begins smashing it over and over and over, but then... everything goes black. The rest of the footage was deleted. |


***Ship Records (Computer)***
You get on the computer and open up the ship's records. Could I get an investigation check?

| 1                    | You don't understand any of it. This is moon runes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2-5                  | You don't really understand the details, but it looks pretty standard for a ship like this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6-10                 | The ship seems pretty official. It's got some blueprints, documentation from it's creation, and a signed seal of safety from the [[Federation]]. You don't understand anything else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 11-15                | These files seem pretty official, but something is off. The blueprints don't really line up at all with your recollection of the ship, and the legal documents seem pretty sketchy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 16-20                | Something is off. The blueprints are completely wrong, there are entire rooms on the blueprints that just don't exist. The records say the ship is brand new, but it's definitely not. It also has a signed seal of safety from the [[Federation]], but it keeps saying the witnesses are "to be determined". Some of the signatures look straight up forged. You don't buy that these are legal for a second. |

***PA System***
- You can make staticky announcements to the entire crew

***Radio***
- This is a general purpose ship radio, it's pretty cheap. You could communicate with nearby ships, or try and intercept messages. Could I get an investigation check.

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1                    | All you hear is static.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2-5                  | You intercept what sounds like a commercial for a Proxima Burger from Proxima Centauri B. "Eat like a winner!"                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 6-10                 | You kind of hear what sounds like a robotic voice, but there's heavy interference cutting through it.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 11-15                | You hear two Japanese men arguing, but it's too staticky to make things out.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 16-20                | You hear two Japanese men arguing. If you speak Japanese, you understand what they're saying. One says, "It's impossible! No one's found any of that in centuries!" The other says, "I know my equipment. Go tell [[House Galling\|the Gallings]]." You then hear some whining radio tuning, and it cuts out. |


### *Cabins*
You enter a cramped room just big enough to fit a twin sized bed, a locker, and a poster from [[House Galling]] incentivizing "Productivity, Courage, and Obedience." There's a vent cover directly above your bed, and whatever other personal items you brought on board.

### *Loading Bay*
The room is sweltering, directly connected to the maintenance area, and the heat seems to press in from every direction. It's the only exit on the ship, a massive metal garage door that only opens when the ship is landed. Splintering wooden crates of various sizes are scattered throughout the room, some half-open, others precariously stacked. A large vent cover in the wall hums softly, struggling to filter out some of the unbearable heat.

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1-10              | Most of the crates are just full of uniforms, and [[Item Catalogue\|flashlights]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 11-20             | You notice a large wooden crate in the corner. It has the words "DO NOT OPEN" stamped on it in deep red lettering. It's splintering, damaged, and looks very old.<br>Its hinges are busted, and it looks like it was recently forced open. There's nothing inside but a few shreds of paper with the symbols "HG.AI-20" imprinted on them. |


### *Ventilation System*
Could I get an investigation check?

| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-5                  | You don't find anything of note, it's super boring in there. It's also very hot, so you're now tired and sweaty.                                                                                     |
| 6-10                 | You find an old sticky note that says, "Gas?" stuck to a pipe.                                                                                                                                       |
| 11-15                | You find a hidden compartment that leads into the walls of the ship. There's a bunch of weird machines wired directly into the walls of the ship. It looks like someone was trying to take them out. |
| 16-20                | You find a false wall in the vents that leads to a room full of 20 of dismantled gas masks neatly ordered into rows.                                                                                 |
### *The Closet*
- It's not really a closet. It's more of a tiny, strange shaped pocket with a door that you've used to store excess personal items. There aren't even any shelves, just junk piled high. 
- There's blankets, pillows, toilet paper, that kind of thing.
