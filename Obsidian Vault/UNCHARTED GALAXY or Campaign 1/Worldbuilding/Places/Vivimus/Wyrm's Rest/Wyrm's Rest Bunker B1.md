**The Lobby**
- (stop mountain ambience--do not play Spotify playlist yet, wait until they exit the staircase room)
- (slow)
- The room is pitch black. The dry hot stink of mildew and dust burns at your nostrils. Using your [[Item Catalogue|flashlights]], you spot a few general details. The walls are bolted with corroded, purplish-blue panels that reflect the light distorted green patterns. Green fabric chairs line the right wall, opposite of a rusted receptionists' desk. At the far wall sits two doors, one of which has been pulled off its hinges, and is now hanging at and angle. 
- (what do you do?) 
	- What are you thinking?
	- (investigating the right door) 
		- It's a 6 inch heavy steel door that seems to have been pulled off its hinges. It easily weighs several hundred pounds. 
		- It leads to a stairwell
	- (investigating the left door)
		- There's no door on the hinges. The opening leads into a cafeteria. 
	- (investigating the desk) 
		- The desk is covered in rust and scrapes. You spot a piece of paper half-buried beneath a stack of discarded folders. The paper is hastily scrawled with a script you can't recognize. The ink is smudged in places, and the paper itself is damp to the touch. There's a filing cabinet to the right of the desk that's flooded with a dark green liquid that smells like sour burning plastic.
	- (investigating the chairs) 
		- The chairs are stained in an unrecognizable chunky green fluid. They smell rank.

**Stairs B1**
- Stepping through the door, you find yourself in a towering cylindrical chamber. The air is noticeably colder here, with a faint breeze flowing upward from the black void below. The staircase hugs the outer wall, descending further than your [[Item Catalogue|flashlights]] reach.
- A map of the facility is engraved into the wall, and there's two doors on the opposite side of the room, one of which is triple the size of the other one.
	- (investigating the map) There are 3 floors, each with a distinctly marked power station. 
	- (door 1 (smaller)) It seems to leave into a series of dorms.  
	- (door 2 (larger)) The door is reinforced with heavy steel plating. A terminal is built into the wall beside it, but its screen remains lifeless. You notice an engraving above the doorframe that simply reads: **"Caverns."**
		- (investigating the heavy duty door). The door is easily 2 feet thick. You'd probably need some power to get that think to move. .
		- (note to DM) it requires Power Stations Alpha, Beta, or Gamma to open. 

**Flooded Cafeteria**
- (NOW start the ambience)
- The smaller door opens to a cafeteria. You walk down a short staircase, leading you down into a vast, low-ceilinged room. A thick layer of black goop—about a foot deep—covers the entire floor, pulsing and rippling faintly. Your [[Item Catalogue|flashlights]] catch the glint of rusting tables and scattered chairs, half-submerged and eerily arranged, as though people fled mid-meal. In the distance, near the far corner of the room, hangs a grotesque sight: a corpse suspended unnaturally in the air, entangled by a mass of black, vine-like algae that seems to shift faintly under your gaze.
- There are **three doors** in total, including the one you entered from. The others sit at the room's far edges, partially obscured by shadows.
	- (investigate the water) You cannot see through it, but you notice that it isn't stationary. 
	- (investigating the doors) There are 2 doors at the corners of the room. Getting closer, you can see that one leads to a kitchen and the other leads down a long hallway to the maintenance sector. 
	- (investigate the corpse) It's eyes are open, and it's missing the lower half of its face. Whatever it was, it was very well armed, bigger than Taure, and it died recently. All of its weapons have been snapped and bent unnaturally.

**Kitchen**
- You step into a cramped, half-flooded kitchen. The ceiling looms low— barely six feet above the floor. The space is a labyrinth of narrow parallel strips of rusted stoves, ovens, countertops. Dark murky water extends 2ft up from the base of the room.
- Perception check
	- (Fail)
		- (play Mikhail noises)
		- You don't notice anything
	- (DC15)
		- You focus your [[Item Catalogue|flashlight]] beam down the hallway. Your light picks up something rapidly twitching in the distance.
			- (Investigating) As you step closer, you realize it’s not a creature, but a root—thin, and spasming violently. Its movements are sharp and erratic, like it’s in pain. 

**Corridor**
- You enter the corridor. Your footsteps echo, unnervingly loud against the silence. It feels like even the air here is heavier in here.
- (Perception check) (DC20 ONLY)
		- You look down the end of the hallway, your [[Item Catalogue|flashlight]] barely reaching the end of it. Then... briefly... you catch the silhouette of a man... striding silently across the intersection at the end of the hallway. He's gone. There was no sound, no emotion, no nothing. No one but you saw anything
- (at the end of the hall)
	- There are two doors one leads to the supply room, and the other leads to the communication room / power station alpha.

**Bunks**
- (NOW start the ambience)
- You step into a dark purple hallway lined with doors, each one leading to a dormitory. 
	- (inside a dorm) the dorm contains two bunk-beds. Each bunk is fitted with thin, moth-eaten mattresses, many of which sag with age. Personal effects are scattered across the room—photos, notebooks, mugs, and other signs of humanity—but everything is in a state of decay. 
	- (investigating the bunks)
		- 01: (Mikhail noise 1d8) From what you can tell, all of the bunks are empty.
		- 02-05: You find a waterlogged and partially rotted teddy bear.
		- 05-10: A faded photograph, showing a straight-faced group of scientists outside of the facility. It's dated 7081. 
		- 10-15: An old piece of paper is hidden under one of the pillows. It reads, "There's someone in my room."
		- 15-20: A waterlogged notebook. A goopy growth of black [[Fernites]] entangle it. It's almost impossible to read, but you get some basic information. It belonged to one of the scientists here, and they apparently worked for the [[Armstrong Initiative]] circa 7081. 

**Power Station Alpha**
- Climbing up the ladder, you emerge into a cobweb-filled room where towering generators loom like silent monoliths. Thick pipes snake along the walls, some leaking faint hisses of steam, while others groan under unseen pressure. The stale air carries the faint metallic tang of rust and ozone, and your footsteps echo dully against the grated floor. A large control panel stands against the far wall, its switches caked in grime and dust. 
	- (pulling the switch and alerting Mikhail)
		- The switch engages with a sharp _snap_, and the generators roar at full capacity. The lights blaze to full brightness, revealing every detail of the room. You hear a deafening screech echoing through the halls. 
			- (Mikhail was alerted)

**Communications Room**
- There's an array of 70s era computers that have been completely deactivated. One of them is connected to a different wire heading into the wall, and is still active. A door on the far wall leads into "power station alpha." There's a ladder in the corner of the room that's covered by bags of trash and spare parts. 
	- (investigating the terminal) The terminal [[links]] to the radio tower, and has been playing the same message over and over. It's been counting iterations, and the total met it's cap at 5 billion. The message is 30 seconds long. 
	- (is played)![[bass Wyrms.wav]]
	- (ladder) Takes you to the records room. 
**Supply Room**
- You step into a room filled with sharp instruments, machine pieces, a box labeled "PROJECT [[CSG and HG Soldiers|DREADNAVE]]"
	- (instruments) Needles, syringes, knives, hooks, etc. There's a bag of congealed blood.
	- (machine pieces) Wires, endoskeleton pieces, containers with a radioactive green fluid, synthetic organs, etc.
	- (PROJECT [[CSG and HG Soldiers|DREADNAVE]]) You peer into the crate and see a hulking, 4.5ft cybernetic arm. It's extremely heavy, and sitting atop 15 bars of solid [[Exotic Metals|Illidium]]. You cannot lift the crate. 
		- (History check [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Dreadnave]]) [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Dreadnaves]] are the soldiers of [[Federation|the Federation]], and (more recently) of [[House Galling]]. 
		- (History check [[Exotic Metals|Illidium]]) A metal native to [[Vivimus]]. It's extremely durable, but very heavy.
