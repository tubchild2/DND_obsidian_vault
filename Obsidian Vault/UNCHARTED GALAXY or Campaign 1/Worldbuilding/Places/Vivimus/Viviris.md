**General**
One of the few flat locations on [[Vivimus]]. The center of all [[House Galling]], [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]], and [[Illeth]] "civilization" if you can even call it that. It's pretty much entirely covered by [[Vivere Mori]]. 

**[[Vivere Mori]]**
See [[Vivere Mori]] for more information. 

**[[Doctrine of St. Galling|Church of Saint Galling]]**
Located to the North East of the city is a private, and enclosed bubble containing a massive, almost palace like church that oversees the entire religion. It's where the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|keeper]] lives. See [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] for more information.
