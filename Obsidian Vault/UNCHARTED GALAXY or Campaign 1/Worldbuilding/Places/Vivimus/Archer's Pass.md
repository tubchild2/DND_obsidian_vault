### Description
The thick fog and ash makes the sky a hazy red. Ahead of you lies the chasm of [[Gorviris]], a toxin filled divider between the north and south of [[Vivimus]]. 
A decrepit dark stone bridge runs across the chasm, and directly into the mountains of [[Beholder's Reach]]. Rotten deformed skeletons lay piled around the edges of the bridge, their bodies riddled with arrows and stones. The air smells of rot and char, and an intense wind twirls the toxic gasses around the base of the bridge. 

*Facing [[Carrion Keep]]*
[[Gorviris|Mount Gorviris]] grumbles behind you, babbling molten metals down into a series of dark canals. 
At the end of the bridge is a 40ft stone gate leading into the mountains. The doors were smashed in a long time ago, as a thick layer of dust has accumulated around the entrance. 

*Facing [[Gorviris|Mount Gorviris]]*
[[Gorviris|Mount Gorviris]] grumbles ahead of you, babbling molten metals down into a series of dark canals.

What do you do?


### Combat Encounter
A shrill, bone-rattling screech tears through the thick mist, sending a shudder through the valley. The sound echoes unnaturally, bouncing off the cliffs before fading into an eerie silence. Then—**the heavy beat of wings.**
Dark, jagged shapes detach from the sheer rock face above, scattering loose boulders as they dive. They plummet toward you at alarming speed, slicing through the fog like razors before unfurling their grotesque forms. **Twisted fusions of lizard, bird, and bat** come crashing down, their malformed wings sending dust and debris spiraling into the air. Their beady, unnatural eyes gleam with hunger as they release a garbled, chittering cry—a sound like _wet stone grinding against bone._

(If Twig Blights)
The air grows _wrong_, charged with something sickly and unnatural. At first, it seems as though the plants themselves recoil from the cockatrices’ presence—but then you see it. The withered shrubs and tangled roots along the roadside begin to twitch, convulsing as though waking from a deep slumber. Slowly, impossibly, they begin to pull themselves free from the dirt, gnarled limbs twisting together into crude imitations of men. The fog shifts unnaturally around them as they stand, hollow eyes locking onto you.

With a chorus of splintering wood and guttural growls, the creatures lurch forward. **You're surrounded.** It's an ambush!

### History
7171 
	The [[Doctrine of St. Galling|Church of Saint Galling]] began an [[Inquisitors|inquisition]] against the [[Illeth]]. The [[Illeth]] had barely associated with the humans, so they were caught off guard. Within days they'd conquered the [[Illeth]] cities in [[Grey Mire]], [[Beholder's Reach]], and [[Viviris]]. The Mountains of [[Gorviris]], specifically [[Gorviris|Carrion Keep]], was the last stand between the [[Illeth]] and the [[Inquisitors|Inquisition]]. Archer's pass bottlenecked their troops, which made it very easy to defend. No enemy had ever crossed the pass unharmed, but the Church had bred an army of [[Inquisitors]]. The [[Illeth]] shot and killed hundreds of [[inquisitors]], but they kept coming. Those monstrous creatures broke down the front gates and seized the [[Illeth]] inside.
