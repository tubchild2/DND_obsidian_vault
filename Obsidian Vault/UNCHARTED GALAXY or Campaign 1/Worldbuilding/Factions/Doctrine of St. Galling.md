## Lessons
The Doctrine of St. Galling revolves around strict principles regarding divinity, destiny, and hierarchy. They were meant to form a new church that was more connected to the roots of humanity, than they were to Christianity. 

#### Core Beliefs
- **A Single, Nameless God**: Followers believe in one God who serves as the ultimate lawgiver and judge.
- **Predestined Destiny**: Every person’s fate is predetermined by God. 
- **Immutable Hierarchy**: The universe operates within a divine hierarchy that reflects the natural order established by God with two extremes, holy and scorned. 
- **The Rapture**: We are living in the "era of judgement," a time when you can make choices to try and climb as high on the hierarchy as possible. Once this era ends, God hand out judgement to the world. The followers will go heaven, and the scorned will go to hell. How this process will unfold is unknown.

#### Hierarchy and Power
- **Real-World Reflections**: The hierarchy correlates directly with real-world power and influence. Those born into power are seen as inherently divine, while the powerless are deemed flawed.
- **Predetermined Status**: Movement within the hierarchy is seen as God’s will; if someone changes rank, it was always meant to happen.
- **Wealth as Divine Favor**: Material success and wealth are viewed as rewards from God for righteous living.
- **Atonement and Sacrifice**: Mistakes lower one’s status in the hierarchy. Redemption requires repayment through significant sacrifices to the church and God. The value of the sacrifice is measured by the suffering it causes the individual, making ascension almost unattainable for average believers.
- **Hereditary Status**: The blood of a great man is viewed as a permanent bump on the hierarchy, and vice versa.  

#### Human Nature and Discipline
- **Purity of Instinct**: Humanity’s “pure” instincts have been corrupted by modern philosophies. A life of simplicity free of complex social structures is the key to enlightenment. 
- **The Summit and the Mire**: The followers are promised a heavenly afterlife of complete freedom in The Summit, a mountainous paradise. The scorned are condemned to eternal torment without free will in The Mire, a disgusting well of filth. 
- **Self-Discipline**: True salvation lies in discipline, both self-imposed and enforced by superiors. Personal discipline reflects one’s dedication to God.
- **Parental Responsibility**: Parents are advised to teach their children the Doctrine early.
- **Financial Contributions**: Regular funding of the church is mandatory to maintain one’s faith and standing within the hierarchy.

### The DSG Code
- **Duels.** If a practitioner is challenged to a duel, they must cease hostilities until a formal audience of CSG representatives are collected. Then, the two will be given equal weapons, gear, and physical care. Due to being given the exact same treatment, the victor is said to be higher on the hierarchy than the loser. The duels are to the death, and once challenged, you cannot back out. Fleeing a duel marks you as scorned, and you're said to go to the Mire regardless of future actions. 2 CSG representatives must be present at the duel for it to count.
- **The Vows of the Scorned**. If you're deemed as scorned, you must stay silent when in the presence of members of the CSG church, and you must not receive any signs of respect until your debt is paid through labor. If you're debt is too great to pay off in your lifetime, you're enslaved by the church and you must work until you die. Doing this gives you a chance at going to the summit. 
- **Respect for Those Above You**. In the presence of someone notably above you on the hierarchy, it's seen as disrespectful to speak unless given permission to do so. 
- **Dedication Trial**. To become a priest of the CSG, you must undergo a trial to determine your knowledge of DSG teachings, your dedication to the CSG, and your history of sin. 
- **Wardship of the Weak**. As a priest, it is your responsibility to educate, and guide those beneath you regardless of their status. You must obey the doctrine in your own life, and you must seize all possible opportunities to spread the doctrine to those around you. Failure to do these things will result in loss of privileges, as well as a sinful debt you must pay off. Good behavior could result in a promotion to a higher rank.
