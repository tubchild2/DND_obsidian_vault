**History**
11933
	The heretics officially form under the lead of Siff Grax, a commanding and intelligent man. Small groups of [[Illeth]] are freed at a time, and led to a camp north of [[Viviris]] called Ollin Hill. It's primarily underground to keep hidden, and food and water are scarce, but it beats slavery. 
	Siff is forming a rebellion against the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] and [[House Galling]]. He plans to draw the attention of the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Dreadnaves]] away from the mountains, then muster a force to overpower the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|inquisitors]] and free the [[Illeth]] in the [[Gorviris|great mines of Gorviris]].
