7070 
	The Armstrong Initiative is founded by the [[Federation]] to produce humans that could match the rest of [[The Galaxy]]'s powerful creatures.

7081 
	The [[Federation]] has the initiative experiment with bioweaponry. They moved onto [[Vivimus]] and established a secure underground bunker in [[Beholder's Reach|Wyrm's Rest]]. During testing, a scientist named Mikhail Volkov created the [[Fernites|Fernite]], a creature designed to be as adaptable and viral as possible. It spread to him, and to the other scientists within minutes. The mutations followed soon after, as the creatures nearby were given part human DNA. The [[Fernites]] rapidly spread through [[Beholder's Reach|Wyrm's Rest]], and emerged onto the surface via geysers and eruptions within days. Once the [[Federation]] was informed, it was far too late. The virus was spreading far faster and more aggressively than they could contain. It quickly overtook the planet, so the initiative destroyed all evidence of their involvement.

	The initiative had completed its task, though in a very cruel way. They were experimenting on children, and seriously harming many of them. However, their experiments led to the production of the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnaves]] via the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnave]] serum.

- [[House Galling|Patriarch]] Simeon Galling of [[House Galling]] reactivates the Armstrong Initiative to serve as an R&D foundation for [[House Galling]] on [[Vivere Mori]]. Additionally, this would give him a use for the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|scorned]] ([[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] teaching) aside from simply executing them. Research into weapons and soldiers could additionally help sustain [[House Galling]]'s power.
- Their HQ was under [[House Galling]], and was a sprawling concrete bunker. 
- They quickly produce a new breed of [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnaves]] using the techniques used to breed the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|inquisitors]]. These new [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnaves]] were more obedient, and could be bred in bulk via the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|inquisitor]] pits. 

10001
- The initiative creates the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|pundits]], and elite [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnaves]]. [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Pundits]] are frail creatures with enhanced intelligence, but skin vulnerable to radiation. Elite [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnaves]] are [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnaves]] with [[CSG and HG Soldiers|pundit]] intelligence, [[Exotic Metals|Illidium]] armor, and higher caliber weapons. 

10012
- Simeon Galling brings the Initiative the injured body of a creature he hit. He had no clue what it was, but it was remarkably durable, and potentially something they could learn from. They quickly discovered that it contained [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]], and after some testing, began farming and selling it.

10020
- They take notice of the [[Tessali]]'s healing factor. It wasn't eating or drinking, so where were those resources coming from? They called this extradimensional source "[[Mythraama]]", and sought to access it. 
- Around this time, they also noted strange, almost portal-like phenomena exhibited by [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] when highly energized. They temporarily expended a large amount of their [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] supply to create a large [[Portals|gateway]]. Nothing of note happened.
- A few weeks later, [[Bradford]] spoke with the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] and the Armstrong Initiative to produce [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]], which was a [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] statue meant to create a larger, more stable [[Portals|gateway]]. The Armstrong Initiative agreed, since they saw it as a potential means to create an infinite energy source. 

10024
	The Armstrong Initiative HQ beneath [[Manor Galling]] burns down during [[Pluto]]'s heist. During the heist, the [[Mano di Dio]] and the [[Tessali]] are stolen, locking [[Bradford]], the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]], and the Initiative out of their plans. They rebuild and move to a new complex in [[Grey Mire]], near the new [[The Royal Palace of House Galling|royal palace]]. 

10065 
	They discover [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] accreted around where the [[Tessali]] was kept. They barely had any, so they couldn't do much. Their primary goal was accreting more of the substance, but they didn't really know how to, so they hit a dead end.
