**General Information**
- An [[Ether]] User is any being (abstract or physical) that has ready access to [[Ether]] and uses it regularly. 
- It's impossible to be an [[Ether]] if you're in a physical [[The True Nature of Existence|realm]] due to [[Ether]] not being produced and immediately manifesting. 
- More powerful thoughts (emotionally charged, influential, unique, etc.) produce more [[Ether]]. 
- [[Ether]]-potent creatures (abstract creatures, very intelligent creatures, creatures that think very fast, are very skilled and experienced with [[Ether]], etc.) produce more [[Ether]]. External factors like [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] can also increase your [[Ether]]-potency. 


**5e Changes for [[Ether]] Users**
- Spiritism is impossible, and all traditional 5e magic is replaced by being an [[Ether]] users. Class specific spells still apply. 
- Terminology changes:
	- Spells -> Fluxes
	- Spellcasting -> Fluxing
	- Metamagic -> Tuning
- Class flavor changes:
	- **CLERICS, WARLOCKS, AND PALADINS**. An important note is that there is no direct communication between the entity clerics, paladins, and warlocks choose to work with / worship. Their existence is ambiguous, but sticking to their religious code absolutely influences their [[Ether|Ether]] abilities.
	- **ARTIFICERS**. Artificers are [[Ether|Ether]] users that manage [[Eathyst and E-Tech|E-Tech]]. 

5e Additions:
- Being in a liminal or abstract [[The True Nature of Existence|realm]] removes all fluxing requirements. For example, you can use "Wish" infinite times, since the laws of physics are so loose and you're producing so much [[Ether]].
- "Produce [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]]" is a level 9 Flux. It allows you to produce a node of [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] from nothing. You can create a node of [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] of a grade determined by rolling 1d6. 
- "Use [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]]" is a new action. Depending on its grade (see [[Ethology Reference Table]]) you can give yourself an additional flux slot. The [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] takes 1 hour to recharge, and you cannot give yourself a flux slot above what its grade is capable of.
