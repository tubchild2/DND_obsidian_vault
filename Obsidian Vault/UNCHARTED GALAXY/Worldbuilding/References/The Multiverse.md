### General Information
Creation is the ultimate source of everything. Creation resulted in the formation of the realms. Each realm serves its own function in the broader ethos of creation. They are not created by people making decisions. Heaven exists beyond the realms, and is not effected by anything within them. 
### Known Realms
1. The observable universe (life)
2. [[Caldwell's Field]] (abstraction)
### The Cataclysm
Creation was the start of everything. Time progresses until eventually the inhabitants of the realms weaken the barrier between worlds to the point of tearing it entirely. The tears cascade and pull the realms together, merging them all into one. All concepts of time and space become irrelevant. There is no longer difference between idea and reality. Everything is deconstructed and moved back to where it began: creation. The cataclysm can cause changes in almost every aspect of creation, and resets reality. The cataclysm lasts an extremely long time, as it waits for things to reset by chance. This event deconstructs everything. Nothing can survive.
