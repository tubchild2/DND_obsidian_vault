Ambience:
- The [[Vivimus]] Ambience Playlist

**General Description**
- (If you're coming from the bunker) You rush out of the large steel door.
- (If you're coming from the hatch) You climb down and down for like 20 minutes before you reach the bottom. You're standing on a ledge, and there's a giant steel door to your right, but it looks deactivated. 
	Stepping out into the caverns, you're met with a vast opening, and a wave of humid air. The caverns are immense, stretching down and further than you can grasp. In the distance, the slick purple stone is unearthed by towering red-root monoliths that pierce the ceiling. Their scale is impossible, and absolute. You follow a staircase down into the caverns, constantly tracking the coordinates to ensure you're on track. The deeper you go, the more you notice a certain rhythm to the caverns. A low rhythmic beat sounds through the walls, the sprawling red roots swell like arteries, and the tunnels seem to constrict as you pass through them. You continue following the path over vast ravines complimented by the wail of creatures unknown. The [[Fernites]] were an insult to nature: they were meant to rip ecosystems apart... and yet they've formed an ecosystem unlike anything else in [[The Galaxy]]. Following the low beeping of your [[Item Catalogue|exosuit]], you hike a quarter mile off course, arrive just a few feet from the coordinates supposed location. A chalky red boulder blocks your path. What do you do? 

- (Moving the rock)
	- You find a hand-carved stone door.
		- (if not done earlier) Could I get a perception check?
			- You know that feeling you get when you're home alone, and you see a door closed with the light on? Or when you get home after a long day and notice something moved. It's not a thought, it's more primal than that. It's an awareness. You can feel someone there, just out of sight. It's instinct: primal anxiety. With no evidence, no reason, no logic, you feel there's someone on the other side. 


**[[Wyrm's Rest]] Trial**
Room 1
	You step into a small hand-carved room. In it lies a single small golden chest on a table, and a sealed door on the opposite side of the room. Below the table the chest sits on is an extremely deep pit. You can't see the bottom. 
		- (inside the chest is [[Pluto]]'s second letter)
		- (the pit requires a sacrifice of an item of immense personal value to progress)

Room 2
	Moving through the door, you find yourselves in awe of the 24 square foot statue of pure [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]]. It's perfectly made, and has no damage to it. It has a shiny purple metallic finish, and weighs next to nothing for something of its size. It's in PERFECT condition. Piled around it is a bunch of loot. 
		- Loot. (DC5 investigation)
			- 5,000[[Galactic Standards|c]] in a brown leather pouch. 
			- Necklace string of small pink pearls. 25 [[Galactic Standards|gp]] (2,500[[Galactic Standards|c]]) 
			- Emerald in a chest. 10 [[Galactic Standards|gp]] (1,000[[Galactic Standards|c]]) 
			- Spiked [[Exotic Metals|Ravite]] Shield. +2 AC, but you can't use two-handed weapons. As an action or bonus action, you can shield bash an enemy for 1d6 bludgeoning. If you were hit after the start of the previous round, you deal 2d8 fire damage instead.
			- Studded Leather Armor. 12 + DEX
			- Scale Mail. AC = 14 + DEX (max 2)
			- [[Exotic Metals|Illidium]] Warhammer. Deals 2d8 Bludgeoning Damage. Heavy (16+). Two-Handed.

**[[Pluto]]'s Second Note**
> My Dear Travelers,
> - I write to you now with a matter of grave importance. The subject matter of this letter and its subsequent trial requires nothing less than absolute selflessness, as your actions moving forward could have potentially cataclysmic consequences.
> - I offer you not treasure, but a quest. A quest of immense importance that I'm unable to complete in my era. 
> - I need you to prove your commitment by sacrificing something important to you, take [[Mano di Dio|the Mano Di Dio]], and destroy it. I don't mean give it to someone else, I don't mean hide it, I mean truly, absolutely delete it. Any fragments of the statue--or of [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] in general--must be reduced to molecules.
> - I didn't understand what the statue was before I stole it. I'd explain all of the forces at play here, but I fear that knowledge like that could lead to dangerous decisions and complicate a simple mission. 
> - Unfortunately, the decision *is* yours. You could choose to give it right back to [[House Galling]] if you wish, and I'd be too dead to stop you. The best I can do is warn you, and beg you to please treat this matter with the same gravitas as I do.
> - Additionally, there's a chance you may have begun having encounters with a man in a suit. I don't know what he is, but he keeps showing up. There's a good chance he's in the room right now. Ignore everything he says or does! Do not listen to him!
