Ambience:
- The [[Vivimus]] Ambience Playlist

**General Description**
- (If you're coming from the bunker) You rush out of the large steel door.
- (If you're coming from the hatch) You climb down and down for like 20 minutes before you reach the bottom. You're standing on a ledge, and there's a giant steel door to your right, but it looks deactivated. 
	Stepping out into the caverns, you're met with a vast opening, and a wave of humid air. The caverns are immense, stretching down and further than you can grasp. In the distance, the slick purple stone is unearthed by towering red-root monoliths that pierce the ceiling. Their scale is impossible, and absolute. You follow a staircase down into the caverns, constantly tracking the coordinates to ensure you're on track. The deeper you go, the more you notice a certain rhythm to the caverns. A low rhythmic beat sounds through the walls, the sprawling red roots swell like arteries, and the tunnels seem to constrict as you pass through them. You continue following the path over vast ravines complimented by the wail of creatures unknown. The [[Fernites]] were an insult to nature: they were meant to rip ecosystems apart... and yet they've formed an ecosystem unlike anything else in [[The Galaxy]]. Following the low beeping of your [[Item Catalogue|exosuit]], you hike a quarter mile off course, arrive just a few feet from the coordinates supposed location. A chalky red boulder blocks your path. What do you do? 

**[[Wyrm's Rest]] Trial**
Room 1
	You step into a small hand-carved room. In it lies a single small golden chest on a table, and a sealed door on the opposite side of the room. Below the table the chest sits on is an extremely deep pit. You can't see the bottom. 
		- (inside the chest is [[Pluto]]'s second letter)

Room 2
	Moving through the door, you find yourselves in awe of the 24 square foot statue of pure [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]]. It's perfectly made, and has no damage to it. It has a shiny purple metallic finish, and weighs next to nothing for something of its size. It's in PERFECT condition. Piled around it is a bunch of loot. 
		- Loot. (DC5 investigation)
			- 5,000[[Galactic Standards|c]] in a brown leather pouch. 
			- Necklace string of small pink pearls. 25 [[Galactic Standards|gp]] (2,500[[Galactic Standards|c]]) 
			- Emerald in a chest. 10 [[Galactic Standards|gp]] (1,000[[Galactic Standards|c]]) 
			- Spiked [[Exotic Metals|Ravite]] Shield. +2 AC, but you can't use two-handed weapons. As an action or bonus action, you can shield bash an enemy for 1d6 bludgeoning. If you were hit after the start of the previous round, you deal 2d8 fire damage instead.
			- Studded Leather Armor. 12 + DEX
			- Scale Mail. AC = 14 + DEX (max 2)
			- [[Exotic Metals|Illidium]] Warhammer. Deals 2d8 Bludgeoning Damage. Heavy (16+). Two-Handed.

**[[Pluto]]'s Second Note**
> My Dear Travelers,
> - I know working your way through [[Vivimus]] was challenging, but it was the only way to guarantee no one found this place for a very long time. Oh I pray you didn't go through that bunker to get here. That place was awful I didn't know that was here. Anyways... THE TREASURE! The 404 billion [[Galactic Standards|credits]] of solid [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]]! The treasure I offered is... well it has certain properties. I understand it's value better than anyone--I went through hell to steal it after all! Well there were other factors to me getting it but that's besides the point. 
> - 
> - As a seasoned pirate, what I'm about to tell you goes completely against my entire being, but unfortunately, the circumstances require it. The statue isn't what I thought it was. It was worth the full 404 billion [[Galactic Standards|credits]] but at the time I didn't know what it was. No one did, really.
> - 
> - I need you to destroy it. I don't mean give it to someone else, I don't mean hide it, I mean truly, utterly delete it. Any remnants of [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] left unchecked are dangerous. I understand the restraint I'm asking of you, but It's not an exaggeration to say that your actions moving forward could have cataclysmic consequences. That's why I'm choosing to leave it's true nature to myself. Knowing anything more could lead you to making dangerous decisions, and I can't risk that. 
> - 
> - I've spent the past 40 or so years attempting to do just that. I've hit it, crushed it, set it on fire, nuked it, thrown it in the sun, and yet... none of it did anything! It's still in mint condition! I know it's possible to damage it: [[House Galling]] cast it somehow! The technology is beyond my access, but in a few thousand years it probably won't be. That's why I hid it here of all places. No one goes here. It's proximity to the bunker freaks even the native creatures out. All I can do is wait, and pray that someone finally has the means to erase it. 
> - 
> - What's terrifying, is that the decision is ultimately yours. You could choose to ignore me, and I'd be too dead to stop you. So... I beg of you... if your intentions are anything beyond utter and complete selflessness, turn and run. Get yourself as far away from this place as possible. Leave it here, and tell no one of its existence. For the love of all that is holy do not give it back to [[House Galling]]. There are some secrets best left forgotten. 
> - 
> - To progress, and attain the treasure for yourself, you must prove your commitment. I need to know you aren't in this for the money. There should be a large pit in the center of the room. If you want to progress, you need to sacrifice something you really care about. This is going to become your top priority. 
> - 
> - P.S. Avoid the man in the suit. Don't panic, but he's probably in the room right now. Don't look at him, don't give him anything, don't acknowledge him at all. I'm not entirely sure what he is but he keeps showing up whenever I do this stuff. I wish I could say he was a ghost or some other entity like that, but truthfully I have no idea where to even begin with that thing.
