**Stairs B3**
- The stairs lead you into an ominous, darkened hallway. As you descend, the air grows heavy, thick with the stench of mildew and decay. The sound of your footsteps echoes against the stone walls, each step feeling like it reverberates through the very marrow of your bones.
- The walls are now an even deeper shade of red, pulsing faintly as if alive.
- At the bottom of the stairs, you spot a door labeled "HOSPITAL," and another labeled "LABORATORY."

**Hospital**
- You open the door to see a cramped stone tunnel lined with doors. There's an unmarked tunnel to your right.
	- (opening the doors) The room holds a single rusted operating table. The floors are slick with thickened blood, and the floors and soaked in organic fluids. The room is deadened, isolated, soundproofed, and--if not for severe weathering--inescapable. 
	- (unlabeled tunnel) Leads to the secured passage

**Secured Passage**
- You follow the tunnel up, down, and around into the dark stone catacombs. The tunnel passes through 3 or 4 checkpoints, each with sealed steel doors that have long since rusted. You get the feeling that whatever lies at the end of the tunnel wasn't supposed to get out.
- You reach the end of the tunnel, and are met with a flat wooden door. The only indication of what's on the other side is some faded text that says, "The White Room." It's still closed, and a low humming comes from the other side. What do you do? 
	- (Opening the door) Leads to the white room

**The White Room**
- The floor is covered in soft white foam tiles, and scattered around the room are brightly colored blocks and unfinished puzzles.

**Laboratory Sector**
- You step out into lab with rows of incubation pods lining the walls, their glass fogged, cracked, and smashed. Weapons and chemical vials sit abandoned, their labels peeling with age. The air smells metallic, the smell evidently emanating from the strange untraceable substance on the many tables. 
- Genetic samples are stored in fridges, as well as an entire skeleton. There are cages everywhere, some of which contain skeletons for humans, and animals. 
- There are multiple doors leading out from here. 
	- There are two private labs
	- Power Station Gamma

**Dr. Volkov's Lab**
- You notice that this door has notably more wear and tear than the others. It seems to have been used far more. 
- You try to open the door to Dr. Volkov's Lab, but something resistsâ€”a sickening, wet squelch, like peeling apart raw meat. A thick and rancid stench clogs your throat. 
	- (entering anyways)
		- There's an ungodly stench, and the walls and lab equipment are stained with an unidentifiable fluid, but it seems pretty nice. It's notably larger than most other rooms in the bunker. 
		- Then you look down and see it... hundreds of bodies: mangled heaps of people--people with lives and families--now left twisted and snapped, as if something had been trying to _sculpt_ with them. Some are stitched together: others are ripped apart and hallowed out. You close your eyes, but the image of their faces is burned into your eyes; they're stretched and split, frozen in eternal shock. 
		- You've never seen anything like it. 

**Dr. Klein's Lab**
- The room is cluttered with anatomical charts, rusted surgical tools, and canisters filled with a condensed yellow chemical flakes. A faint chemical smell lingers in the air. 

**Power Station Gamma**
- You enter a room with several bioelectric generators, and a large switch. There's also a staircase that leads very far underground.
	- (pulling the switch and alerting Mikhail)
		- (Switch 1) The first switch locks into place. A low hum rumbles through the room as the generators sputter to life. Weak vibrations shudder up through the floor, and a faint glow flickers in the overhead bulbs .Somewhere distant, you hear a _clink..._ 
			- (25% Mikhail was alerted)
		- (Switch 2) - The second switch engages. and the hum deepens into a steady drone. Overhead, the lights brighten slightly, casting long, distorted shadows that shift as the machinery comes to life. Pipes rattle as pressure builds, and you catch a faint hissing noise from the far corner of the room. 
			- (50% Mikhail was alerted)
		- (Switch 3) The third switch activates, followed by the rhythmic thudding of machinery deep within the facility. The lights stabilize, casting a cold, clinical glow over the dark room. The hum of the generators is now a steady roar, and a breathy wail echoes through the facility. 
			- (75% Mikhail was alerted)
		- (Switch 4) The final switch engages with a sharp _snap_, and the generators roar at full capacity. The lights blaze to full brightness, revealing every detail of the room. You hear a deafening screech, followed by thunderous footsteps approaching your location. 
			- (Mikhail was alerted)
