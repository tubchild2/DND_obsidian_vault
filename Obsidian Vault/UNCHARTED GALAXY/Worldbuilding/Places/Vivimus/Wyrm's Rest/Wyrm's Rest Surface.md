**Exterior**
- (Start ambience)
- (Slow)
- After days of slogging through the ungodly terrain of [[Vivimus]], and just recently crossing over the nightmarish hell-scape that is [[Chimera Crags]], you reach [[Wyrm's Rest]]. It's a small, circular clearing with a thin layer of mist, and a border of jagged boulders. The ground is soft and flat, with deep red grass sprouting from the mist. The air is crisp and fresh, and for a moment, the silence isn't ominous, it's peaceful. The second sun continues to rise as twilight turns to night; the second sun casting a warm, but dark purple glow over the planet. 
- Sitting in this moment, you feel relaxed for the first time in ages. You sit yourselves down in the clearing. Everything, the cabin, the city, the mountain, has led to this moment. You feel a strong sense of determination to finish the quest, but that quickly gives way to unease and confusion as you actually stop to think about the circumstances you've found yourself in. For the first time, you ask a very important question, "what's going on? Like really? What are we doing?" Who *was* [[Pluto]]? Why did his coordinates lead here? Why would someone *just give* away 404 billion [[Galactic Standards|credits]]? None of it makes any sense. There's absolutely some kind of catch, because this whole journey (while difficult) is kind of ridiculously easy considering what you're getting in return. But... you made it this far so who knows! 
- (What do you guys want to do?)
	- (Checking for the coordinates) 
		- Your heads up display activates and flashes the coordinates. The position [[Pluto]] gave you is a mile beneath the clearing, deep into the caverns of [[Wyrm's Rest]]. At this point, you also notice a small metal hatch in the center of the clearing. It seems to lead down to the coordinates. 
		- As you stand there, a strange, pulsing noise emanates from your suit. It’s faint at first, but then it grows louder. The suit’s built-in radio is picking up something nearby.
	- (investigating the radio)
		- You're standing roughly in the clearing. You're pretty far from [[Chimera Crags]] at this point, so its dark. You can't really see more than 15, 30 feet in front of you.
		- Your [[Item Catalogue|exosuit]] begins honing in on the signal. After a few seconds, it gets a lock on it's position and frequency.
		- Play ![[bass Wyrms.wav]]
		- It's repeating over and over. You know nothing about how long its been there or what it is. As your [[Item Catalogue|exosuit]] displays, the source is about a half mile north east from here. 
	- (investigating the hatch)
		- It's a square metal hatch with a window in it. You can't see anything through it, as it seems to lead very far underground. There's no handle.
			- (Attempting to break it) It has an AC of 15, and 200 hp. Nothing less than dynamite could crack it open.
			- (Attempting to open it) DC17 Athletics check to open it without the handle. 
				- (Interior) Inside the hatch is a very old ladder going very deep underground. It leads to the caverns. 
	- (general perception check on the area)
		- Atop a nearby hill you spot another cockatrice. There's something sinister about this one—its talons are ragged, its face scarred, and its body easily 10x the size of the last few. The creature’s beady red eyes lock onto your position: its posture is low and tense. It looks enraged, and ready to strike. But oddly enough... it takes a look to your area, lets out a sharp, irritated whine, and flies away. 
		- You also spot a hatch in the center of the clearing. 
	- (Tracking the radio transmission)
		- A compass flickers to life on your HUD, pointing you vaguely in the direction of the transmission’s source.
			- (if they follow) 
			- You begin tracking the signal roughly north by northeast. You climb over the rocks of the clearing and move way out of the way. There's no path here, so you're blind navigating over awful terrain. After about 20 minutes of hiking, you feel completely lost in the wilderness of [[Vivimus]], but in the distance you spot a radio tower poking up from a small dirt hill surrounded by towering rock spires.

**The Pit**
- The radio tower is jutting out from the hill at an awkward angle, mostly buried in centuries of dirt. Below it lies an abrupt, jagged drop about 11 feet down--akin to a sinkhole. A windswept and rusted metal staircase leads down into the pit. Your immediate area is cluttered with barbed wire fences half-sunk into the dirt. Among the tangled mess, a sign juts out from the ground.
- What do you do?
	- (investigating the sign) You approach the sign and wipe away layers of dirt and dust, revealing a faded red message. It reads, "Restricted area; no trespassing; [[Federation]] property."
	- (investigating the pit) You saunter into the pit. It's roughly 5ft across, and contains an 8ft heavy duty steel door. It's rusted, scarred, boarded up, and sealed with hazard tape. There's a 1ft hole in the top left corner of the door, and a faded plate to the right of it. 
- (what do you do?)
	- (investigating the plate) You wipe away the thick coating of red dirt that's accreted on the panel. In dark embossed letters, it reads, "[[Armstrong Initiative]] BWP *dash* **7081CE**"
	- (opening the door) The boards splinter easily in your hands, and the tape peels away with barely any resistance. The hinges on the door are extremely rusted, and the door resists opening.
		- (trying harder) Could you make a dexterity saving throw? You lean up against the door, and push as hard as you can. The hinges groan, and with an alarming snap the door falls in. 
			- Failure. You fail to catch yourself in time and fall forward into the room.
			- DC10. You catch yourself and stop yourself from falling in.
