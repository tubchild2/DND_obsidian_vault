![[The Bunker of Wyrm's rest.webp]]

### General Information
- Located on [[Vivimus]], in [[Beholder's Reach]]
- Contains a bunker operated by the [[Armstrong Initiative]] several thousand years ago. Was a prime location for horrific experimentation on kids to produce soldiers capable of rivalling the local alien empires. It also gave way to the creation of the [[Fernites]], which completely wiped out the planet. They mutated everything, bonded DNA across creatures, and completely upturned the biology of the planet ([[Vivimus]])

### Tips for the Session (GIVEN THEY GO TO THE BUNKER)
1. **Fear of the Unknown.** Keep players in the dark about what is going on, and don't show the monster for awhile. Show the impacts of the monster, and build up questions about what they are, let suspense build, make it unclear what their motives are, etc. 
2. **Immersion.** Put a lot of effort into detail, and ambience.
3. **Disempowerment.** Make players feel outmatched, weak, and like they could actually die in here.
4. **Tension.** Use tense situations in combination with horror. Time limit, stealth, etc.
5. **Body Horror.** This the source of the [[Fernites]]. The humans that ran this bunker were completely infected and mutated into tall, nimble, and quiet humanoid monsters. 
6. **Monster.** Unknown motives, shouldn't be here, clearly more powerful than the players, uses body horror. Mimics PC voices (if they're separated). 

 **Homebrew Rules**
7. **Hallucinations.** Sometimes, a party member will spot something out of the corner of their eye that no one else sees. The other players will need to succeed a DC15 WIS check to see it also. Once one additional player sees it, everyone does. 
8. **[[Mikhail Volkov|The Monster of Wyrm's Rest]].** ([[Mikhail Volkov]] is present)
9. **Separated Players**. While separated in game, for this session, they will be physically separated, or other players will somehow be kept in the dark.
