**Elevator B2**
- The walls on this floor are a much deeper, and redder purple. 
- There's a single door labeled "THE WORK ROOM"

**Offices**
- The door leads you into a short ceiling room full of offices. Dividers and cubicles cover the floor, giving the smaller room a mazelike appearance. False windows line the far walls, appearing to have used LEDs to simulate the appearance of sunlight. 
- A straight path continues forward into "B2 Junction A."
	- (Cubicles) each one is standardized, with a single terminal, a cabinet, and some pencils. 
		- (Cabinet) You find folders containing files and files of names, their ages, and whether they're "processed" or not. There are thousands of names, most of which are 10 and under. All of them are marked as "processed" up until about halfway through 7082, where a batch of about 500 of them are unfinished. 

**B2 Junction A**
- You step into a room with a spiral staircase. It's a wide purplish-red cylindrical room that has 5 doors including the one you entered from. All of them are marked very clearly.
	- Offices
	- Something Center (it's scratched out) (leads to "corridor with the door")
	- Power Station Beta
	- Meeting Room
	- Records Room

**Corridor with the Door**
- After about 5 minutes of walking, you find a suspiciously deep staircase that you similarly can't see the bottom of. Pressing forwards, deeper, and deeper, for about 10 minutes of descending, you find a solid steel door with no peepholes. 
- (stop the ambience temporarily)
- Could I get a perception check?
	- You know that feeling you get when you're home alone, and you see a door closed with the light on? Or when you get home after a long day and notice something moved. It's not a thought, it's more primal than that. It's an awareness. You can feel someone there, just out of sight. It's instinct: primal anxiety. With no evidence, no reason, no logic, you feel there's someone on the other side. 
- The Door leads to "His Music Room"

**His Music Room**
- (cut all audio)
- (pause for a long time)
- You're completely alone.
- You're in what used to be a meeting room. The tables and chairs have all been smashed, but there's a record player in the center of the vast empty chamber with a blinking green light.
	- (if pressed) Play this very loudly, coupled with the [[Mikhail Volkov]] alert sound effects. 
	- ![[playthisloud.wav]]
	- Perception Check? Say nothing regardless of what they roll. 

**Records Room**
- The door leads down an uncomfortably long staircase. At the bottom of which, you find the records room. It's got to be 200ft of just ordered filing cabinets. There's a door on the opposite end of the room. 
	- (checking a random filing cabinet) 
		- You see that it's thousands of lists of people. Most of them are under the age of 10, and they're all marked processed. 
		- You see shipment requests for [[Exotic Metals|Illidium]], several tools, and an enormous amount of chemical and medicine requests. 
		- You see copies of reports sent from this station to the greater [[Armstrong Initiative]] in [[Federation|the Federation]]. They're old, but they detail a few of their projects. 
			- The "bioweapon project" had been fruitless for several years, but Mikhail and his [[Fernites]] were showing signs of progress." 
			- Some mention "Project [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Dreadnave]]" but they aren't detailed. 
			- The final few logs detail that the "equivalence project" was making steady progress, but that they'd need several thousand more patients to progress with the next phase. These logs all end with "we will fight for our history, we will fight for our species, and we will fight for our progression."

**Power Station Beta**
- You enter a room with several short and stacked chemical generators with some kind of radioactive red fluid. A large switch lies at the end of the room, covered in massive cobwebs. 
	- (pulling the switch and alerting Mikhail)
		- (Switch 1) The first switch locks into place. A low hum rumbles through the room as the generators sputter to life. Weak vibrations shudder up through the floor, and a faint glow flickers in the overhead bulbs .Somewhere distant, you hear a _clink..._ 
			- (25% Mikhail was alerted)
		- (Switch 2) - The second switch engages. and the hum deepens into a steady drone. Overhead, the lights brighten slightly, casting long, distorted shadows that shift as the machinery comes to life. Pipes rattle as pressure builds, and you catch a faint hissing noise from the far corner of the room. 
			- (50% Mikhail was alerted)
		- (Switch 3) The third switch activates, followed by the rhythmic thudding of machinery deep within the facility. The lights stabilize, casting a cold, clinical glow over the dark room. The hum of the generators is now a steady roar, and a breathy wail echoes through the facility. 
			- (75% Mikhail was alerted)
		- (Switch 4) The final switch engages with a sharp _snap_, and the generators roar at full capacity. The lights blaze to full brightness, revealing every detail of the room. You hear a deafening screech, followed by thunderous footsteps approaching your location. 
			- (Mikhail was alerted)

**Meeting Room**
- You enter a room with a large central metal table surrounded by knocked over chairs. A busted projector sits on the table, pointed towards a flat wall. 
- A massive egg is growing on the table. It's white, with huge black veins.
	- (breaking it open) a thick green and black fluid pours out of it.
