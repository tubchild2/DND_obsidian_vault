### General Information
- A noble democracy of the three elven lineages (high elves, wood elves, and Drow)
- Their main planet is extremely well developed, and their moons are mostly empty. 
### History
- Founded on Aethium.
- After the discovery of space travel they expanded to the neighboring moons.
### Traditions
- **Lumineth**. Once an elf reaches maturity (50 years old), they travel to Elarion for a year-long spiritual retreat. The journey itself is a symbolic rite, representing the transition from the familiar to the unknown. While there, they study the history and wisdom of their ancestors. 
### Primary Territories
1. **Aethium**. (homeworld). An extremely developed world. The entire planet is a beautiful city with controlled weather. The skies are always clear. Predominately high-elves.
2. **Elythra**. A moon of Aethium. A verdant world filled with lush forests, crystal-clear rivers, and towering mountain ranges. Cities are more spread out, and hidden beneath the foliage. Predominately wood-elves.
3. **Eldamar**. A moon of Aethium. As a consequence of its position, "day" on Eldamar is a long stretch of twilight. Bioluminescent forests and fungi cover the surface, and most civilizations are underground for clean water. The moon has oceans of a thick purple fluid called "rot-water" that's extremely acidic. 
4. **Sylvalis**. A moon of Aethium. A barren moon used for farming. It's much less populated than the other Elven territories. The surface is covered in large glass spherical greenhouses. 
5. **Elarion**. A moon of Aethium. Made up of rolling meadows, gentle hills, and peaceful coastal towns. A spiritual and artistic hub. A place of creation, reflection, and peace.
6. **Presley**. A moon of Aethium. An industrial moon that powers Elven society. They mine, refine, and produce raw materials of the highest standards. For an industrial moon, it's beautiful and extremely efficient.
