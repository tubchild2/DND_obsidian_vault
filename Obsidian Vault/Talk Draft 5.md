There's an old saying, one you've likely heard before, "You never really know something until you teach it to someone else." Being capable of teaching people about prophecy is a valuable skill for a Christian to develop. It's no doubt one of the most important parts of our faith, especially today, but at times, it can be challenging to fully wrap your head around it without a deep knowledge of the Bible. So, in this discussion we're going to briefly answer two questions: what is prophecy, and how were prophecies received?



**WHAT IS PROPHECY**

Let's start with what prophecy is. At first, many might assume it's essentially just a prediction about the future from God. However, prophecy doesn't necessarily have to involve foretelling the future, and there are many instances where it doesn't. 

A great example of this is found a John 4:17-19 if you'd like to turn there with me in your Bibles. We saw this account at our convention a few months ago. As we recall, Jesus was speaking to a Samaritan woman that he had just met at a well. That's John 4:17-19. It says,
- 17 The woman replied: “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her: “You are right in saying, ‘I do not have a husband.’
- 18 For you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. This you have said truthfully.”
- 19 The woman said to him: “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.

So what was going on here? Jesus had revealed information about her past that he only could've learned through a divine revelation. He wasn't alluding to the future at all, and yet he's still called a prophet.

So if prophecy doesn't have to involve foretelling the future, what is it exactly? The Bible provides an answer at 2 Peter 1:20, 21, turn with me there if you'd like. 2 Peter 1:20, 21. It says,
- 20 For you know this first, that *no* prophecy of Scripture springs from *any private interpretation*.
- 21 For prophecy was at *no time* brought by *man’s will*, but men spoke *from God* as they were moved by holy spirit.

Notice the last part where it says that men spoke *from* God. That would from imply that the words they were speaking originated with God. So, prophecy, then, is a message inspired by God, or a divine revelation.



**HOW WERE PROPHECIES RECEIVED**

But how did the prophets receive messages from God?

We're going through Isaiah, so I thought a good place to start were with visions. If you recall, in Isaiah chapter 6, Isaiah had a vision of the Seraphim and spoke to the voice of Jehovah. Visions like these were so vivid that the prophet could participate in them. According to Acts 10:10, some of the visions were transmitted while the prophet was in a trance. Others were conveyed via dreams, like the dreams King Belshazzar had that Daniel interpreted.

In at least one case, Jehovah directly supplied written works to his people, like with the 10 commandments. But this is evidently a much rarer form of communication.

Besides those, many prophets were mentally guided by God to convey his messages. According to 2 Timothy 3:16, that's what happened with the writers of the Bible. That verse tells us that "all scripture is inspired of God". The phrase, "inspired of God" can also be rendered as, "God-breathed." So, God used his holy spirit to sort of "breathe" his ideas into the minds of the Bible writers. In other words, he guided their thoughts, allowing the prophets to use their own wording, but to transmit God's messages. 

One way to think about this is like the owner of a company having to deliver a message to the employees in one building. They'll tell the manager what they need to know, and then that manager will tell the employees. They'll likely do it in their own unique way, but the core important ideas will remain intact. 

Lastly, on some occasions, Jehovah sent Angelic messengers to directly communicate with the prophets when precise wording was important. Jehovah did this many times. In Exodus 3:2, while Moses was in the wilderness, "Jehovah’s angel appeared to him in a flame of fire in the midst of a thornbush." And there are many more examples of this throughout the Bible.



**CONCLUSION**

So, overall, what is prophecy? Well, we saw in 2 Peter 1:20, 21 that prophecy was any message inspired by God. And the Bible showcases many ways these messages were communicated including writing, angelic messengers, visions, and mental guidance. So, with this information, if you're asked to teach about prophecy, you can give an accurate explanation that comes from the Bible.
