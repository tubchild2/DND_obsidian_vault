A dank, nearly uninhabitable forest moon. The terrain is unnavigable, with steep muddy cliffs, mile wide trees that block your vision, and rivers big enough to swallow a house. The weather is unbearable, with a constant onslaught of heavy floods, thunderstorms, and thick fog. The creatures here are vicious, cold blooded monsters who'll tear you apart without a second thought. Sometimes, their thundering roars can be heard over the rain. Typically, not the kind of place you'd want to visit.
