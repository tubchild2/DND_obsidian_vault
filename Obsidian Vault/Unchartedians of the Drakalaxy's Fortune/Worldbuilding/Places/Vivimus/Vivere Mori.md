# General Information
- Located on [[Vivimus]], in [[Viviris|Viviris Valley]]. 
# Description
Muri Vivi is a hub of wealth and industry, but it's prosperity came at a cost. The city is a chaotic tangle of neon lit streets, where criminals and corporations alike vie for power. On the lower levels of the city, it's perpetually dark, only lit by dim florescent lights and holographic ads that assault the senses. The air is thick with grime, and the streets teem with danger. While on the streets, you cannot see the sky thanks to the towering overlap of monolithic structures piled atop one another. 

The planet is extremely dangerous, so the entire city is protected by gargantuan 2000ft high, and 400ft thick black steel walls. It's also protected by a gigantic, 400ft thick glass dome that covers the entire city. there are also extensive underground systems in place to vent gasses and magma out of the city to prevent eruptions. This was meant to keep [[Fernites]], magma, toxic fog, the toxic air, chemical rivers, mutants, extreme winds, and filter the intense sunlight. The city is a circle with a 60 mile diameter, which is split into 31 6-mile slices.

Their primary export is [[Illidium]] from the [[Gorviris|great mines of Gorviris]]. Most laborers are [[Illeth]] slaves, and they can be seen all over transporting items, doing grunt work, and quietly discussing the [[Heretics]].
