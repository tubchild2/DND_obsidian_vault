### General Information
- Located on [[Vivimus]], in the [[Beholder's Reach]] region. Connects [[Mistriven]] to [[Chimera Crags]]. 
### Location Descriptions
**Spiral Stair Climb**
- The entrance to the pass is marked by a **gothic-engraved tunnel**, its **dark stone** weathered and cracked from centuries of neglect. The **oval-shaped archway** looms overhead, its intricate carvings barely visible beneath layers of soot and creeping moss. A faint, musty breeze seeps from within, carrying the scent of damp stone and something older—something forgotten. Inside, you see the base of a **pitch black, spiraling staircase**, its steps worn smooth and crumbling at the edges. 
	- The climb feels **endless**, the sheer blackness of the tower distorting your sense of time and distance. Then, just as your breath begins to quicken from the exertion, a faint **glow** ahead marks the stairwell’s exit, leading you out into the **beginning of the pass**.

**The Beginning of the Pass**
- Emerging from the tunnel, you find yourself **high within a ravine**, surrounded by towering, jagged cliffs that rise like the walls of a forgotten fortress. The **air is dense with fog**, rolling in thick waves that obscure everything below—you cannot see the ravine’s bottom, nor the distant landscape beyond. Shadows shift within the mist, hints of movement that could be tricks of the light… or something lurking below.
- The pass stretches ahead, a **linear march of bridges, watchtowers, and winding paths** that carve through the ravine. **Metal-railed staircases**, once sturdy, now hang in disrepair, their rusted frames groaning under the weight of time. **Stone platforms** jut from the cliffsides, some partially collapsed, others overtaken by vines and moss. **Small caves and tunnels** dot the rock face, offering potential shelter… or hidden dangers.
- Time and the relentless advance of nature have left much of the pass in ruins. **Steam vents hiss** from unseen cracks in the stone, releasing bursts of scalding mist that swirl and dissipate into the fog. **Bridges sag under their own weight**, their stone foundations weakened by age. **Overgrowth** clings to every available surface, with **red-leaved vines** creeping across ancient masonry like veins of a sleeping beast.
- Despite the decay, the path forward is **clear but unyielding**—a single, harrowing march toward **[[Chimera Crags]]**, where the mountain’s true dangers await.

**Cave 1**
- You enter a small crevice and into a damp cave. Water pools below you, and it feels cooler in here. It's pretty quiet, aside from the occasional dripping of water.
- Perception Check:
	- You spot some large bones sticking out of the ground. It seems to be the half buried skeletal remains of some kind of large worm.
	- There's a shallow pool of water. There's an Amethyst Ring at the bottom (200c).  

**Obstacle 1**
- The ravine pinches around a large stone watchtower with intricately detailed windows on the upper floors. The next leg of the journey seems to be on the other side. 
- Unfortunately, the tower is completely overgrown. Its once-grand stone pillars barely visible beneath a tangle of thick, crimson vines. The air here smells earthy and damp, filled with the scent of moss and decaying foliage. The tower itself, though sturdy in construction, is now nearly obscured by the rampant overgrowth of trees and vines.
- What do you do?

**Obstacle 2 / Library Tower**
- When you step inside, you find yourself in a **library**—though it's clear that time and neglect have taken their toll. Books are scattered across the floor, some torn and others left open, as though their owners abandoned them in haste. 
- There are two doors you can take to move deeper into the pass. One has steam coming out of it, and the other is covered in vines.
	- Perception Check on the books
		1. Book on the [[Illeth]] Empire (read the prehistory section)
		2. Book on [[Illeth]] biology (read race description)
		3. Book on the [[Fernites|Fernite]] infestation (read the 7082 section)
		4. Book on the arrival of humans (read the 7105-7107)
	- Perception check for hidden rooms
		- You notice a concealed area behind a bookshelf
		- Its a small shelf with more books.
			- Perception check the books
				- Its a book describing "recent events" from the perspective of an [[Illeth]] scribe. See the section later in this page.
	- Perception check for rare items
		- There are 3 dusty silver chalices (50c), some old maps of [[Vivimus]] (12c), and a cracked group photo of some guards (5c)

**Obstacle 3a**
- A group of tall silver-trunked, crimson-leaved trees have popped up. A thick canopy of trees has overgrown this entire area. 
- The bridge has collapsed in the center, leaving a 8ft gap between both sides that drops down into a misty chasm. Trees surround the bridge the whole way.
- What do you do?

**Obstacle 3b**
- An area riddled with steam vents. The stone platform you need to cross is riddled with holes that periodically shoot scalding steam.
- What do you do?

**Cave 2**
- The air smells stale and metallic, like something bled out here a long time ago. Looking down, it immediately drops about 8ft into a square pit. There are two short skeletons with tails down there.
- Perception Check (if you get down there)
	- Judging by the outfits, these two were criminals. 
	- One of them is carrying a ceremonial dagger engraved with images of a beast made of winding tendrils. ([[Tessali]]) It's very old and fragile. (350c) 

**Obstacle 4**
- The paths link back up
- You see the exit to [[Chimera Crags|The Chimera Crags]], but it looks like a landslide happened. The tunnel is large enough to travel through, but a giant rocky nest has been made from the rubble. 

Roll 1d4
1-2: 3 Cockatrice
3-4: 3 Cockatrice and 2 Twig Blights

(If they already fought the cockatrices in [[Mistriven]])
	The nest is completely empty. 
(If they haven't)
	2 Cockatrice lie sleeping in the large rocky nest.
	(If twig blights)
		Two creatures made of twigs seem to be patrolling around the nest, messing with the stones.

### [[Illeth]] Scribe Book
The world had always felt heavy, as if the earth itself bore a quiet, unspoken burden. Life on [[Vivimus]] was harsh, but it was our life, and we had grown accustomed to its unrelenting nature. Our cities stood proudly in defiance of the volcanic wasteland, our people resilient in the face of adversity. It was, by all accounts, peaceful. At least, it was... until the morning the silence was broken.

I still cannot comprehend what happened. We had no warning. No signal, no omen. It came without the slightest hint of disturbance, as if the air itself betrayed us. At first, it was just a whisper of movement—a ripple, like the calm before a storm—but that whisper soon became a roar.

They came without mercy. The [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Inquisitors]] descended upon us like a wave of destruction, their forms towering and grotesque. Tall, hulking monstrosities, their faces featureless, their limbs too long for their twisted, mechanical bodies. At first, we thought they were merely soldiers, perhaps part of a faction we'd never seen before. But no, these were not soldiers; they were **things**, driven by a singular, unrelenting purpose: annihilation.

Their robes bore the insignia of **[[House Galling]]**, but I hardly recognized them. These beings moved not with the fluidity of men, but with the mechanical precision of puppets, mindlessly crushing everything in their path. There was no hesitation, no pause for reflection, just a cold, unyielding march of death. We could only watch as they tore through our cities, obliterating everything we had worked for. In the span of a single day, **[[Mistriven]]**, **[[Veldiris|Veldhelm]]**, **[[Grey Mire|Saltspire]]**,—our homes, our sanctuaries—fell to ruin. I still hear those screams in my mind, each one a haunting reminder of what was lost.

In the chaos, I fled. Along with the survivors—those who could still move, those who had not been struck down in the carnage—we retreated. Our only hope was Fennhollow Pass, where I now stay hidden. I don't know much longer we can stay here. If we don't make it out of here... I hope that these words will carry the memory of our people.
