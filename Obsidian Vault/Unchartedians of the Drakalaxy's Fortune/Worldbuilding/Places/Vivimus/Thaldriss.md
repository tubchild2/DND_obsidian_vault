**The Black Graveyard / Thaldriss [[Illeth]] Ruins**
An [[Illeth]] settlement once occupied this valley. During the [[Fernites|Fernite]] infestation of 7082, Mount Thaldriss was overtaken. Tremors began rocking the town, until Mount Thaldriss erupted. The resulting wave of heat, lava, and [[Fernites]] destroyed the town, and left ashen statues of the residents behind.
