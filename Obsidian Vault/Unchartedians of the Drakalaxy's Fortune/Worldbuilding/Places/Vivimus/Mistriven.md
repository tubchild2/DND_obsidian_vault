### General Information
- Located on [[Vivimus]], in the [[Veldris]] region.

### Opening Description
- You step out into a deep valley, the mist swirling thick around you. It's strange; you didn’t know _[[Vivimus]]_ had naturally occurring water, but the fog that hugs the valley seems to be seeping from the mountains south of here—_[[Fennhollow Pass]]_.  
- A lingering wetness in the air feels like something foreign, a chill that should not exist on this volcanic world. It's an uneasy kind of mist, one that clings to your clothes and sinks into your bones.  
- Ahead, rising from the fog, is the ruined village of Mistriven. The jagged stone structures—charred red and gray rock from the very bones of _[[Vivimus]]_—are mostly collapsed, their former grandeur now shadowed by decay. Red and silver plant life grows in twisted bursts from between the cobblestone paths.  
- Though you can’t see much through the thick fog, the village seems to sprawl across the entire valley. It feels as if it was once a place of life and vitality, now suffocated beneath the haze.

Perception Check?
- With a creak of wind, something catches your eye down the main street. A flag, strange in design, is planted in a pile of _regal corpses_. The flag flutters in the dense mist, black and red—bearing the symbol of a bloody red circle with a black X stitched in the center.  
- The bodies beneath the flag are far from human—tall, gaunt figures in regal red and gold robes. Their faces are gone, replaced with an oozing white-red substance that seeps from their open, hollow forms. The stench of rot is sharp and immediate, filling your nostrils as you take in the gruesome scene.


### Combat Encounter
**(AS THEY'RE LEAVING)**
A shrill, bone-rattling screech tears through the thick mist, sending a shudder through the valley. The sound echoes unnaturally, bouncing off the cliffs before fading into an eerie silence. Then—**the heavy beat of wings.**
Dark, jagged shapes detach from the sheer rock face above, scattering loose boulders as they dive. They plummet toward you at alarming speed, slicing through the fog like razors before unfurling their grotesque forms. **Twisted fusions of lizard, bird, and bat** come crashing down, their malformed wings sending dust and debris spiraling into the air. Their beady, unnatural eyes gleam with hunger as they release a garbled, chittering cry—a sound like _wet stone grinding against bone._

(If Twig Blights)
The air grows _wrong_, charged with something sickly and unnatural. At first, it seems as though the plants themselves recoil from the cockatrices’ presence—but then you see it. The withered shrubs and tangled roots along the roadside begin to twitch, convulsing as though waking from a deep slumber. Slowly, impossibly, they begin to pull themselves free from the dirt, gnarled limbs twisting together into crude imitations of men. The fog shifts unnaturally around them as they stand, hollow eyes locking onto you.

With a chorus of splintering wood and guttural growls, the creatures lurch forward. **You're surrounded.** It's an ambush!

Roll initiative.

Roll 1d4

### Area Descriptions
**City Center / The Flag**
- The flag, adorned with the black X on a red circle, seems religious in nature. You don’t recognize the symbol, but it exudes an aura of dark reverence, as though it were planted as a macabre offering. Looking around, you notice hundreds more bodies piled around the edges of the buildings. 
- But the bodies are not human. These tall, gaunt creatures are wearing the regalia of _[[House Galling]]_—fine red and gold robes that are now soiled with a mixture of white and red ooze. Their faces are missing, replaced by twisted, hollow voids. The stench of rot is unbearable, and you can feel the air around you thicken with the oppressive weight of their decay. This place is a grave, not just for the dead, but for everything that was once here.

**Farm**
- On the northernmost side of Mistriven lies what used to be a farm. The land here is overgrown—rows of silver-trunked trees with deep crimson foliage, now choking the life from the once fertile farmland. The wind stirs the branches, but no fruit or flowers can be seen. It’s as if the land itself has been poisoned.

**Metalworker**
- Near the center of the town lies a crumbled forge with a large silver-wooden door with holes and claw marks in it.
	- (if they attempt to open it) You feel resistance keeping you from opening the door.
	- (DC5 STR) You push as hard as you can on the door, and you hear a large snapping sound as the door flies open. Looking behind the door, you see the now snapped and crushed skeleton of a 4ft creature. Looking around, the room looks raided. Some fragments and shavings of steel, copper, silver, and another metal you can't identify are strewn throughout the room.

**Manor Ruins**
- The building was clearly bombed—the blast left only skeletal foundations and scattered debris. What was once a grand estate has been reduced to broken stone and warped metal, with a few half-standing walls casting jagged shadows in the fog.
- The ruins are eerily quiet, save for the occasional groan of shifting rubble. The scorched remains of furniture and shattered glass crunch underfoot. Faint scorch marks and melted stone suggest that whatever weapon was used to destroy this place was not of mundane origin.
- Perception Check? 
	- Beneath one of the collapsed sections, something glints under the dust and rubble
	- You see a elegantly carved metal picture frame. It shows two short creatures with thick grey skin, large black eyes, and long winding tails. The larger one is dressed in luxurious regal clothing, and the other is dressed in simple, childish clothes. There were more people in the frame, but those corners of the photo were clawed off. 

**Tavern / Inn**
- You see what appears to be an old inn. All of the windows have been smashed in, and the front door was ripped apart. Claw marks stretch from end to end of the walls, some of which puncturing completely through the walls.
- (If Inside) 
	- The ceilings are notably low, making movement a challenge for Taure, Copper, and Bjorn. The inside has been rearranged with desperate purpose. Heavy furniture has been dragged against doors and windows in a frantic attempt to fortify the space. Broken tables and chairs lie stacked against entry points, and long drag marks stretch across the warped silver-wooden floor. Deep claw marks score the doors, gouged into the wood and stone where some kind of army tried to get in. But... what kind of army could have done this?

**Church**
- A towering gothic structure rises above the mist, its once-majestic pillars now weathered and cracked. The windows have been smashed in, and the door is riddled with countless gashes and claw marks.
- (If Inside) Inside, the cold stone walls are lined with faded murals, their figures almost unrecognizable beneath centuries of decay. At the heart of the church stands a shrine, carved in the image of an unknown creature made of intertwining tentacles and eyes. It's engraved with something in [[Illish]] ![[Mistriven text.png]]

**Well**
- You see a small burnt well. It's completely dry and dark, but it smells like rotten eggs. A thin green mist has settled in it, obscuring your vision of the bottom. 
- Leads to a cavern full of sulfuric acid. DC16 CON saving throw to prevent taking 2d10 acid damage. 

**Watchtower / Archery Point**
- The two towers on the western edge of Mistriven stand as a remnant of a time before the fall. The gates leading to them are dilapidated, and pools of sulfuric acid have begun to form around the stone. 
- (If they enter)
	- You see a winding stone staircase leading to the top of the tower. The stones supporting the structure are beginning to fall apart, and the mist here feels hot, and stings as you walk through it.
	- Climbing to the top reveals a breathtaking yet ominous view: across the _[[Gorviris]]_ chasm, the ancient stone bridge that connects [[Gorviris]] to [[Beholder's Reach]] looms, its stonework worn and cracked. On the horizon, the volcano _Mt. [[Gorviris]]_ churns with molten magma, casting an ominous glow over the land.

**Port**
- To the east, the village’s port stretches out into a river of mercury. Rusted barges are tethered to docks made from a strange silver-wood, the metal oxidized with age. The air here feels thick, and the water’s surface reflects a glimmer of the firelight from the volcano in the distance, giving it an almost liquid mirror sheen.

**Approach to [[Fennhollow Pass]]**
- On the south side of the village lies a gargantuan cliff face and mountain range. This path leads to [[Beholder's Reach]], but it looks decrepit.
