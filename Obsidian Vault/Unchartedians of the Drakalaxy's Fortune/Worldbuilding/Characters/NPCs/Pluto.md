### 10000
> Pluto Winton Haywood was born in a small, lower-class village on Pluto (the planet). Though dirt poor, he aspired to become the greatest adventurer who ever lived. He wanted to be a space-pirate, a treasure hunter, and filthy rich. It's customary for males to take the planet's name and go by their middle name, but Pluto wanted a name that was simultaneously iconic and inconspicuous. That's why he decided to go by Pluto after leaving home. He still follows Plutonian customs, like paying his respects to the great moons, celebrating Plutonian new years (once every ~248 Earth years) (he did once), yearly ice sculpting, and habitually keeping candles and fires burning through the night due to Plutonian winters being infamously cold and dark.

### 10024
> Pluto is contacted by Emily Galling (the current [[House Galling|patriarch]]'s wife) ([[Bradford]]) with inside information about [[House Galling]], [[Manor Galling]], their plans, and that they had spent 404 billion [[Galactic Standards|credits]], and 98% of the [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] on a pointless statue named [[Mano di Dio]]! It had some silly religious explanation for existence, but Pluto knew it didn't matter. He gathered his men together, and executed the heist on [[Manor Galling]]. During the heist however, Pluto uncovered a secret basement door that wasn't in the plans. Curious, he looked around, and discovered the [[Armstrong Initiative]], as well as the barely conscious [[Tessali]] being tortured. It then finally clicked why Emily would want her own empire to fall. Enraged at the situation, he derailed the plan to try and free the [[Tessali]], and burn the [[Armstrong Initiative]] (and [[Manor Galling]]) to the ground. His men turned on him to try and get the statue out, but the uncontrollable fire quickly turned things into a firefight between them and security. Pluto escaped with the [[Tessali]], and [[Mano di Dio]], leaving his men behind to die. Pluto then retreats to his home on mars, only to find his family and friends executed. With nothing and no one, Pluto retreats into [[The Deadwoods]], and begins living off the grid in a small cabin he built ([[Pluto's Cottage]]). He aims to protect the [[Tessali]] from [[House Galling]]. Unfortunately, the [[Tessali]] is pretty much comatose after being tortured and experimented on for so long. It'd be a long time before it recovers from that. 

### 10024 - 10063
> Pluto hid out at his cottage ([[Pluto's Cottage]]). But the more time he has to think about it, the less it all makes sense! Why would [[House Galling]] make such a pointlessly expensive statue? Why was it designed like that? Where did the [[Tessali]] come from, and why was it full of [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]]? On that topic, what *is* [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]]? Is it a metal? Then why was it inside the [[Tessali]]? What type of creature *was* the [[Tessali]]? As far as Pluto could figure it didn't have any organs, just a mess of tentacles with a face. A piece of the puzzle was missing, and Pluto desperately wanted to find it. But he couldn't leave his cottage, it'd be too much of a risk.

### 10064
- One of [[House Galling]]'s bounty hunters ([[Aaron Haynes]]) managed to track down [[Pluto's Cottage]] in [[The Deadwoods]]. [[Aaron Haynes]] attempted to kill him, but Pluto got the upper hand and impaled him with his own sword before he could signal for help. The fight was sloppy, and brutal, and if it wasn't for dumb luck he would have lost. The [[Tessali]] was strange, and he desperately wanted to understand it. Yet, he respected it. It was clearly much more powerful than anything he'd heard of, and whatever role it played in the ecosystem was clearly beyond him. He liked it, but it was at this point that he realized that he couldn't trust himself to take care of it anymore. Someone would find it, so he wanted to be absolutely certain that it wasn't [[House Galling]].
- Pluto reached out to the [[Illeth]] [[Heretics]], who likewise wanted to sabotage the plans of [[House Galling]] and the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]]. With the help of the [[Heretics]], he could both construct a series of trials to find a new protector for the [[Mano di Dio]] / the [[Tessali]], and he could investigate the questions that nagged at him over the past 40 years with his own private research team. It'd take another 10 years to complete the trials. 
- Pluto built a handful of research buildings on a blizzardy ice planet called [[Merak-B]]. The snow was so intense, that you couldn't tell where the land ended and the sky began, it was all white in all directions, and extremely foggy. Him and the [[Heretics]] used this station to experiment with the [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] and the [[Tessali]] to figure out what [[House Galling]] was plotting.

### 10071
- On [[Merak-B]], Pluto and the [[Heretics]] began a test in which they searched for 4D creatures by using the [[Tessali]] as a genetic template. Using a sample of its DNA, they began shooting rapid signals out into 4D space to check for similar creatures. After a while, they began detecting something moving rapidly towards their beacon. Suddenly, a large snake-like mass of tendrils, mouths, and legs emerged from nothing and charged the beacon. It devoured the sample of [[Tessali]] flesh and began hunting for more. It began ripping the [[Illeth]] apart, and with a wail it shattered an entire building. Pluto and the remaining [[Heretics]] fled to the ship with the [[Tessali]], but the beast trailed behind. With a spiked tendril it severed one of Pluto's legs. The [[Heretics]] picked him up and dragged him to the ship. Before it could warp inside, the [[Illeth]] scientists used a projection device to lock the creature in 3D space. 
- The entity latched onto the ship and began pummeling its exterior to get to the [[Tessali]]. They took off before it broke in. Thankfully, it now seemed to be bound to the planet, but it had destroyed their research, and claimed countless lives.

### 10072
- No one understands what happened on [[Merak-B]]. A [[Heretics|heretic]] meeting is called to discuss how to move forward with the trials knowing what they now know. They gathered in a hidden settlement deep in the jungles of [[Merak-A]].  
- Pluto was paranoid. He'd studied ancient legends that spoke of creatures like that. Beings so far above us, that even the good natured ones couldn't help but hurt us. Whatever he'd brought clearly wasn't natural, and they clearly didn't understand it. Whatever it was, it seemed to be pretty clearly related to the [[Tessali]] biologically. That begged the question, what would the [[Tessali]] do once it woke up?
- The [[Illeth]] moved to execute the creature. It was already weakened, but if it woke up and decided it wanted to hurt people (which wasn't unlikely, due to the severe treatment of [[House Galling]]), it could pose a serious threat to life as we know it. We already know it can fly and rapidly heal, who's to say it couldn't kill too?
- Pluto disagreed. The [[Tessali]] was a historically peaceful beast. It had been around longer than any of them, and if it *did* want to hurt people, it would've done it already. We don't know for sure if it's related to the entity on [[Merak-B]], but even if it is, they aren't the same creature! The fact is, despite being tortured, the [[Tessali]] never lashed out at [[House Galling]]. The risk is borderline non-existent! Whatever purpose the [[Tessali]] serves in the eco-system is beyond them, and they shouldn't mess with things beyond them!
- But the risk still existed, and more importantly, killing the [[Tessali]] would guarantee [[House Galling]] never got it. Majority of the [[Heretics]] moved to kill it, and Pluto threatened them. The argument got more intense as the [[Heretics|heretic]] leader got involved personally. He argued that Pluto lost his leg to a creature like the [[Tessali]], he should know firsthand that it's not to be trusted! The meeting began to split into two sides, and before long, the [[Heretics]] began moving to Pluto's residence on [[Merak-A]] to kill it themselves. Then, a single gunshot went off, and the leader of the [[Heretics]] fell to the floor. Pluto had shot him. The meeting devolved into madness as both sides began fighting. Pluto and his followers made it to his home first, and overpowered the other [[Heretics]]. 
- Paranoia about their actions began to set in, and the group began to slip. They hung the skeletons of the rival [[Heretics]] as warnings, and built an elaborate underground complex to protect the [[Tessali]] at all costs. The hunt led here, and this final trial would put them to the test to ensure they knew what they were getting into. They forbade each other from leaving [[Merak-A]] out of fear of loose lips. 

### 10077
> Pluto's paranoia about the remaining [[Heretics]] got the better of him. He bombed them, and began using their bones to build traps. Then, in the innermost chamber of the [[Tessali]]'s dungeon, he died of starvation, and his bones are still there to this day.
