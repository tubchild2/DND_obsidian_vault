**General**
	A [[CSG and HG Soldiers|sanctumborne]], and the personal sentinel of [[Bradford|Bradford Galling]]. All of their humanity has been stripped away, and they were born from a cauldron of genetically modified organic matter. They're 9ft tall, and the product of 30 years of conditioning.
	Faster, stronger, smarter, more durable, more *everything*. On top of that, they have much more Eathyst than even the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Templars]]. 
	Wields [[Weapon Catalogue|the warknuckle]], a 947lbs, 644 million [[Galactic Standards|credit]], [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] / Eathyst / [[Exotic Metals|Illidium]] warhammer. 

**Abilities**
- [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Inquisitor]] Speed. Can take 2 actions per turn.
- [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Dreadnave]] Charge. If there's a visible target within 10ft of the current one, [[Bradford]] can move 10ft and make another attack action. He can do this up to 3 times. 
- [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Dreadnave]] Rage. Gains max level barbarian rage. However, while enraged, he has disadvantage on INT, CHA, and WIS checks and saving throws. 

**History**
11994
	Their genetic material was formed and perfectly assembled. After a few weeks, they were ready to begin conditioning.
12024
	They've completed conditioning, and are the first [[CSG and HG Soldiers|sanctumborne]] to ever survive the process. They're by far the strongest unit [[House Galling]] has, and so they're relegated to protecting [[Bradford]].
