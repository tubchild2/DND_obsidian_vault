### Lore and Roleplay
**Personality**
- **Mysterious.** He keeps his cards close to his chest to prevent any insurrection. 
- **Unpredictable.** He's more intelligent than you, and his plans are beyond your understanding. 
- **Very High Above You.** He doesn't respect anyone, and sees himself as a god. The power difference between him and anyone around him is staggering.
- **Intelligent.** His thesis is "order" which is an abstract, constructed idea that's unnatural. He's definitely a [[Primordials and Feeders|complex primordial]] granting him remarkable intelligence. He knows every thought that's ever been thought about order.
- **Dangerous.** He can and will kill you at a moment's notice if you threaten his authority.
- **Manipulative.** He's a master chess player. He can and will lie and cheat to ensure his victory is absolute. He doesn't even need to, since he's an excellent strategist. He delegates to an order of followers he has absolute control over. 

**Backstory**
Prehistory
- Came to being when life starting thinking about order.
- The de facto leader of the [[Primordials and Feeders|primordial]]. They listened to him in the field whenever he encountered them.

10020
- Tod was following the [[Armstrong Initiative]] from [[Caldwell's Field]] As soon as he got the chance, he formed a [[Primordials and Feeders|Theophany]] and flew away to investigate the brand new world he found himself in.
- He realized that directly assaulting the empires would never work, as they're far too great in number. If he wanted to destroy them, he'd need to weaken them from the inside, and he'd need more [[Primordials and Feeders|Theophany]] to fight their armies. 
- Returning to the [[Armstrong Initiative]], he was shocked to see that they had already dismantled and sold the components to the [[Gateways|gateway]].
- Late at night, he built his physical body and appeared outside [[Bradford]]'s bedroom door. He woke him up, and the two had a private conversation. Tod told [[Bradford]] that he was an angel, and that he needed [[Bradford]]'s help. 
- Tod said that he'd make the world a better place. With his abilities, he could make a world with no stress, no unfair treatment, no nothing! No one would ever suffer. He'd tear down the current systems and make a new one in which culture and life would flourish. He just needs [[Bradford]]'s help to build another [[Gateways|Gateway]]. [[Bradford]]'s faith was unshakable, and he agreed to work with him.

10024
- [[Mano di Dio|The Mano di Dio]] (the key ingredient in making a larger [[Gateways|gateway]]) was stolen by [[Pluto]]. With no way to produce [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] without the [[Tessali]] (which was also stolen), Tod's plans were ruined.

12024
	He's spent 2000 years forcing [[Bradford]] to comb [[The Galaxy]] for [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]]. Tod additionally established a network of followers throughout [[The Galaxy]], and is poised to begin crumbling it from the inside. He's also continued increasing the scale of [[House Galling]]'s armies to prepare for galactic conquest. 

**Agenda**
1. Put cracks in the empires, and establish a network of followers.
2. Find [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]].
3. Use [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]] to build many more [[Primordials and Feeders|theophany]] to act as his army.
4. Crumble the empires, and fill the power vacuum with his own order. 
5. Create a world in which he is in absolute control of everything everyone does.

**Appearance**
- A being made of smoky black tendrils.
- Wears gold and black armor with organic designs. 
- Wears a long red cape that turns to smoke at its ends.
- Wears a helmet with a white face plate with 4 ripped holes in it, and a golden crown with horns and holes in it.
- Stands at 9'1"
- Sprouts organic, thorny, black, spider-legs with a gold trim. He uses them when he needs them. They emit black smoky tendrils.
