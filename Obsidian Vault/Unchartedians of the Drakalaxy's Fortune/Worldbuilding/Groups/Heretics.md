**History**
10018
	It had been about 3000 years since the [[Illeth]] were enslaved, and they'd finally gained enough footing to establish a small rebellion. Only about 30 people at first. They worked with Emily Peterson (later Emily Galling, [[Bradford]]'s wife) ([[House Galling]]) to attempt to destabilize [[House Galling]] from within. 
	Their HQ was on [[Merak-A]]. 
	Founded by Sheil Vani. A soft-spoken and reserved man who spent most of his time studying and planning rather than leading.
10024
	Their plan worked fabulously, and even resulted in [[Manor Galling]] burning down thanks to [[Pluto]].
10052
	Enzo Amma is put in charge of the Heretics. He's a hot headed and firm leader. 
10064
	[[Pluto]] comes out of solitude and meets with Amma with questions about what he stole. They both wanted to sabotage the plans of [[House Galling]], the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]], and the [[Armstrong Initiative]], so finding out what they were up to was a great goal. 
	In exchange for access to [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]] and [[Tessali]], [[Pluto]] needed to build some trials to find someone new to protect them after his death, since he was getting quite old. 
10071
	On [[Merak-B]], one of [[Pluto]]'s research stations accidentally spawns a nightmarish, violent creature that bears a striking resemblance to the [[Tessali]], and has a lot of similar properties.
10072
	A heretic summons is called on [[Merak-A]] to discuss what to do about the [[Tessali]]. A divide quickly forms, and half the people side with Amma to kill it and abandon the trials. Amma begins leaving with his men to do it himself, and [[Pluto]] shoots him. The heretics break into gunfire, and they race to [[Pluto]]'s residence. [[Pluto]] beats them there, and he kills the remaining Heretics loyal to Amma. 
10077
	Out of paranoia, [[Pluto]] kills the remaining heretics. He believes that they're plotting to kill him, and that they can't be trusted with the secrets of the [[Tessali]] and the [[Mano di Dio]]. 
12024
	The heretics officially reform under the lead of Siff Grax, a commanding and intelligent man. Small groups of [[Illeth]] are freed at a time, and led to a camp north of [[Viviris]] called Ollin Hill. It's primarily underground to keep hidden, and food and water are scarce, but it beats slavery. 
	Siff is forming a rebellion against the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] and [[House Galling]]. He plans to draw the attention of the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Dreadnaves]] away from the mountains, then muster a force to overpower the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|inquisitors]] and free the [[Illeth]] in the [[Gorviris|great mines of Gorviris]].
