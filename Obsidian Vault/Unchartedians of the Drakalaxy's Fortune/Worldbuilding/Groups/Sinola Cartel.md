### Overview
They're the primary distributors of [[Overclock]] to the central plate of [[The Galaxy]]. They evade and enervate the laws of their local governments to maintain a complex web of shipments and producers throughout [[The Galaxy]]. They hide in plain sight, and make deals in high places to keep the wheels from squeaking. 

They have a history of making deals with the [[Armstrong Initiative]]. In exchange for uncommon chemical agents, and limited legal intervention, they'd exchange their prisoners. One of the victims of this was Bjorn (PC), who slandered them online. Not wanting any attention to be brought to them, they captured him and passed him to the initiative, who experimented on him, turning him into a Giff.
