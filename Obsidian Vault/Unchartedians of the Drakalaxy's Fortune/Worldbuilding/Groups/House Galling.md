### History
7096
	On the [[Federation]] planet "Mars," [[Doctrine of St. Galling|Saint]] Finn Galling penned the [[Doctrine of St. Galling]] ([[Doctrine of St. Galling|DSG]]). It was a set of neo-Christian beliefs centered around real-world success related to the morality of the men who achieved it. He firmly believed in his teachings, and formed the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|Church of Saint Galling]] ([[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]]). Finn believed that his writings would form a new church that was more connected to the roots of the human experience, and that could help people become happier, and more successful in the modern galactic age. His charismatic promotion of the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|DSG]] allowed the church to spread quickly throughout Finn's home planet of Mars. 

7100 
	Finn met with [[Federation]] representative to establish his family as a house. This gave him the legal authority to establish two things. First, that the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] rightfully belonged to his family, and second, that the right to rule over the house and the church would be passed down to the firstborn male where possible. 

7105 
	Finn took interest in the recently corrupted planet of [[Vivimus]]. It was abundant in metals (especially [[Exotic Metals|Illidium]]), chemicals, and thermal energy. On top of that, it was so dangerous that it was nearly entirely unclaimed. The surface was still incredibly dangerous due to volcanic activity and the spread of the [[Fernites]]. 
	Finn established a religious mining colony called [[Vivere Mori]]. It was sealed in by walls and a glass dome. The abundant resources quickly attracted settlers, then businesses, then immigrants, and soon, an enormous following for the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]]. The [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] was relocated into the city. 

7107
	The [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] and [[House Galling]] were encountering problems with the native people of [[Vivimus]]. The [[Illeth]] are humble creatures that lived underground. Their surface settlements were carved from the earth, and designed with moats and trenches that force the mists and toxic winds into them. They're humble, shorter, and immune to toxins and extreme temperatures. They're weaker than humans, but much more nimble, quiet, and durable. Their vision is excellent, and they don't blink. They need very little hydration to live, and only need to drink a few ounces every few days. Their skin was thick enough to resist the [[Fernites]], but the recent exaggeration of their climate had damaged their civilizations. [[Vivere Mori]] was expanding to its limit due to their land. So, Finn met with the leaders of the [[Illeth]] to establish a deal but the [[Illeth]] refused to give up their land. 

7166 
	[[House Galling]] and its Patriarch, as well as the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] and its [[Doctrine of St. Galling|keeper]], formed a plan to conquer the [[Illeth]] territories outside of [[Vivere Mori]]. The [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] would run a religious campaign slandering the [[Illeth]] for their practices and culture. While they were ruining their public campaign, [[House Galling]] would create the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Inquisitors]]. The [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Inquisitors]] were an army of mindless slaves grown in the pits beneath the city. They would form an army controlled by the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] to execute a holy war on the [[Illeth]], and capture their land. 

7171 
	The [[Inquisitors|Inquisitor]] army was completed. Public perception of the race had become disgusting, so the holy war begun. The [[Illeth]] had no armies, and stood no chance against the hordes of [[Inquisitors]]. The [[Inquisitors]] captured and enslaved the [[Illeth]], and put them to work within the mines and in the [[Inquisitors|Inquisitor]] pits. They lived in small dirt pits covered by tarps. Any rebels, apostates, or escapees were publicly executed using the [[Inquisitors]]. 

7222 
	[[Vivere Mori]] had surpassed one million residents. In light of this, the acting Patriarch of [[House Galling]] relocated the headquarters of [[House Galling]] into the center of the city. They wanted to ensure the commercial growth of [[House Galling]] was in-tact. 

9992 
	Patriarch Simeon Galling reactivates a private version of the [[Armstrong Initiative]]. He wanted to live longer, and he wanted a use for the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|scorned]] aside from simply executing them. Additionally, research into improved soldiers and [[inquisitors]] could help to secure his power. Their HQ was small for such a project, and hidden under [[Manor Galling]]. 

10012 
	Patriarch Simeon Galling uncovers the [[Tessali]] after hitting it with his ship. They bring it to the [[Armstrong Initiative]], and quickly discover [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] They're initially apprehensive of the new material, but after learning of its properties, they immediately begin farming it and selling it to high ranking military officials, to the [[Federation]], and to empirical representatives. They were making billions per day, and by the end of the year, they were the most wealthy group in [[The Galaxy]]. 

10018 
	Simeon Galling dies, and [[Bradford|Bradford Galling]] is made Patriarch. 

10020 
	The [[Armstrong Initiative]] noted strange, almost portal-like phenomena exhibited by [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] when extremely energized. They created a huge [[Gateways|gateway]], and nothing of note happened.
	A few nights later, [[Bradford]] agreed to work with [[Primordial of Order|Tod]] (under the belief he was an angel). [[Bradford]] is now working for [[Primordial of Order|Tod]].
	[[Bradford]] convinces the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|CSG]] and the [[Armstrong Initiative]] to work with him to produce a larger, more stable [[Gateways|gateway]]. They'd create a [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] statue called [[Mano di Dio|the Mano di Dio]], and use it to create a [[Gateways|gateway]] stable enough to satisfy [[Primordial of Order|Tod]]. They agreed for their own reasons. 

10024
	[[Pluto]] robs [[Manor Galling]]. He was given all of the information he would need thanks to Emily, Patriarch [[Bradford]] Galling's wife, who betrayed him for the sake of the [[Heretics]]. During the heist, [[Pluto]] discovered the [[Armstrong Initiative]], and the [[Tessali]]. He freed everyone, and his men revolted. The heist devolved into a firefight, and [[Manor Galling]] went up in flames. [[Pluto]] made it out with the [[Mano di Dio]] and the [[Tessali]], despite knowing nothing of either of their true nature. In response to it being stolen, [[Bradford]] executes [[Pluto]]'s friends and family, and anyone present during the heist (including his own men). He then relentlessly pursues [[Pluto]] with an army of bounty hunters, but to avail. The [[Armstrong Initiative]] is relocated to an underground complex on [[Vivimus]], and [[Manor Galling]] is rebuilt into [[The Royal Palace of House Galling]] on the coast of [[Grey Mire]], specifically [[Grey Mire|Butte Galling]].
