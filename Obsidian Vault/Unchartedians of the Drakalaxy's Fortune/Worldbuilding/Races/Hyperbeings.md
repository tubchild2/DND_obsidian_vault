> "I saw a well dressed man the other day. He seemed to be looking at me from across the way. I approached him and asked why he was looking at me. He said he was "reminiscing." He walked away without another word--I'm not really even sure where he went. 
> - Kyle Graham, the night before his disappearance.

### General Information
The others (also called hyperbeings) are enigmatic, 4D entities that exist beyond the conventional flow of time and space. Their nature is largely unknown, and their motives remain inscrutable. Time is a flexible thing, and they seem to be the only beings in the universe to have any means to alter the set course of events.

### Abilities
**Spacetime Teleportation**. 
	They can teleport to any point in space time. It takes half a second to disappear here, and half a second to reappear there.

**The Chameleon Mechanism**. 
	They can shapeshift into whatever form best suits the information they have about a given point in space and time. This process takes half a second. The true scale of their bodies exist outside of our perception, meaning what you see could be a hollow sac of skin, rather than containing vital organs. 

**Omniscient.** 
	They never forget anything, and have knowledge of past and future events. In the span of 1 second, they could leave and return having spent an unknown amount of time doing as many things as they want, and those around them would have no reason to assume anything changed. 

**Unclear Origin**
	They reproduce via paradox, so where they actually came from is unclear. It's possible that all others that exist today could have descended from one. However, we still don't know where that one (if it existed) came from.

**True Influence.** 
	Every decision a being makes is their own, yet all choices are shaped by prior events. The timeline is not a branching tree but a fixed, linear pathâ€”every action is predictable based on the past. 
	However, if an event **deviates** from what was predetermined, reality does not split into branches. Instead, the existing timeline is overwritten, erasing all future events and replacing them with new ones. 
	The Others are the only known entities capable of **introducing true change** to this otherwise rigid timeline. Their interventions, no matter how small, ripple forward, rewriting the course of history. They're capable of observing this without experiencing change, but for everyone else, it's as if this was always going to happen.

**Paradoxical Avoidance.** 
	The Others exist beyond causality, allowing them to break the natural laws of time without consequence. They have the ability to:
		1. Observe, remember, and act on changes happening to timelines as they happen.
		2. Exist simultaneously in one point in time in multiple places
		3. Communicate with themselves across time consequence free. This past version of them has new information on which to act, functionally creating a new Other that'll make different decisions. This is how they reproduce. 
	They can act on information they gained from timelines that have been erased, can exist in multiple places at once, can interact with themselves from the past and future, and they can observe changes in the timeline without their histories being impacted. 

**[[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] Blood.** 
	Their blood (and flesh for that matter) is made of a hyper-condensed organic material. To them, it acts as standard flesh, but to us (3D beings), it's unlike anything else in the world, and possesses traits beyond what the laws of physics typically allow.

### History
- The [[Tessali]] is the only documented Other. It was wounded by [[House Galling]], and kept in a weakened state to the point of brain-death. It's recovering, but slowly. 



# REWRITE
Abilities:
- Omniscience. Knowledge of the past, and of all possible futures. They have a perfect memory.
- 4D
	- [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] Blood. Their blood (and flesh for that matter) is made of a hyper-condensed organic material. To them, it acts as standard flesh, but to us (3D beings), it's unlike anything else in the world, and possesses traits beyond what the laws of physics typically allow.
	- Teleportation. It takes half a second to disappear here, and half a second to reappear there.
	- Awareness. They can look through the 4th dimension, giving them a 6th sense, which is better than standard vision, is in all directions, and can see through objects.
	- Phasing. They can become intangible by moving in the 4th axis.
	- Inconceivable Form. The true scale of their bodies exist outside of our perception, meaning what you see could be a hollow sac of skin, rather than containing vital organs. They can store an impossible amount of matter inside their bodies in a pocket dimension.
- Shapeshifting. 
	- Limitations. They can alter and manipulate their organic matter, and do not experience aging due to overwriting their cells. However, they're always physically weak, and lightweight, no matter their size or appearance.
	- Chameleon Mechanism. They shapeshift into whatever best suits the information they have about a given point in space and time to blend in. This process takes half a second. 
	- Reproduction. They can reproduce via mitosis. They shapeshift and split into a second hyperbeing, which manifests in the general proximity of the hyperbeing.
- Telekinesis. They can use their massive 4D bodies to interact with our world in ways we can't perceive. This is significantly more effective than physically attempting to do things. It allows them to make any STR or DEX check with advantage from a distance less than or equal to 60ft.
