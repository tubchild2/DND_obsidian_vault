### Individual Units
**Inquisitors**
	Creatures bred for their speed and numbers. They're genetically engineered and are born in pits. They have no faces, are 8ft tall, have disproportionately large hands and appendages, and they can run and climb 45ft per second.
![[The inquisitors.jpg]]

---
**Enforcers**
	A basic law enforcer for [[House Galling]] territories. Given training and protection akin to modern military today. 

![[Enforcer.png]]

---
**Dreadnaves ([[Federation]])**
	They're humans with the dreadnave serum, and permanently attached power armor. They're remarkably efficient soldiers due to extensive, borderline torturous training and brainwashing. 
	They received a 30% concentration dreadnave serum.
	7ft tall.

![[FED Dreadnave.jpg]]

---
**Dreadnave Serum**
	A serum that granted the Dreadnaves additional organs, rapid healing, and enhanced physical abilities. Higher volumes and concentrations of the serum tend to produce more genetic aberrations, and can be inconsistent.

**Dreadnaves ([[House Galling]])**
	They're genetically engineered creatures born from [[Grey Mire|Inquisitor pits]]. They're stronger, faster, and more obedient than normal humans, but still receive the same 40% concentration dreadnave serum.
	7ft tall.

![[HG Dreadnave.jpg]]

---
**Pundit**
	A lab grown creature with increased intelligence. They're frail specialists, and typically work as engineers, medics, and advisors. They do not do grunt work, as that is reserved for the [[Illeth]]. They simply design and plan unless their role requires their intervention. 
	They're horribly deformed, and their skin is sensitive to radiation, even from the sun, so they choose to wear full helmets and coverings. 
	They're typically around 4-5ft tall. 

![[Pundits.jpg]]

---
**Elite Dreadnave**
	A combination Pundit and Dreadnave. They're bred to be leaders of dreadnave battalions.
	They're given a 50% concentration dreadnave serum, making them rare due to the initial poisoning this incurs. 
	Given [[Illidium]] power armor and [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] infused specialty weapons. 
	8ft tall. 

![[Elite Dreadnave.jpg]]

---
**Templar**
	By injecting the blood of a lab grown subject with millions of tiny fragments of [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]], they gain extremely chaotic abilities. They're fragile, gaunt, and deformed. Their hands stretched and their skin turned white. Though lacking control of the [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] they channel, they channel so much of it that it doesn't matter. They're horrifically powerful and destructive entities, that are quite the glass cannons.
	To prevent enemies from salvaging their [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] they channel all of their [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] and detonate on death. 
	They're very weak, slow, unintelligent, and deformed, but remarkably powerful.

**Sanctumborne**
- Becoming one takes decades of conditioning, and 98% of applicants don't survive. They're made from lab-grown flesh and assembled perfectly. The [[CSG and HG Soldiers|Sanctumborne]] are the apex of everything they're worked towards.
- They have the intelligence of the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|pundit]], the speed of the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|inquisitors]], the strength of the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|elite dreadnaves]], and the [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] of the [[CSG and HG Soldiers|templars]]. They receive a 75% [[CSG and HG Soldiers|dreadnave]], 25% pure [[Eathyst and E-Tech|Eathyst]] serum. 
- They outclass all other units in every regard, but are remarkably rare.
- They're the only units that *might* be given access to [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] weaponry, as they're bred to protect the highest authorities. 
- 9ft tall.
