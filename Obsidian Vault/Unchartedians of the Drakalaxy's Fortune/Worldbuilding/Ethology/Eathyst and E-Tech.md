### Eathyst
**General Information**
- **Eathyst Leaks [[Ether and Unether|Ether]].** Eathyst is a crystalline substance that leaks [[Ether and Unether|Ether]]. It does this because it contains a tiny puncture point in spacetime. It's not even close to being considered a [[Gateways|gateway]], since it's unstable and a result of natural phenomena.
- **Eathyst Forms Around Weak Points.** Eathyst accretes around weak points in spacetime, especially [[Gateways]].
- **Appearance.** Eathyst resembles a golden crystal.
- **Electrical Response.** Eathyst is highly conductive, and will leak [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] when exposed to electricity. Advanced computers can send extremely precise signals that emulate brainwaves, and essentially program the [[Ether and Unether|Ether]]'s idea.
- **[[Ethology Reference Table|Pyte]]-Rate (PPH) and Grade.** The [[Ethology Reference Table|Pytes]] of [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] Eathyst produces is called its [[Ethology Reference Table|Pyte]] Rate, and is measured in [[Ethology Reference Table|Pytes]] per Hour (PPH). The scale at which it manages [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] is called its "Grade," which ranges from 1-10. 
- **Raw PPH.** By default, Raw Eathyst has a set PPH / Grade based on its size. (See [[Ethology Reference Table]].)

**Properties**
- Melts at 1,084c
- Boils at 2,562c
- Density: 3g / cm^3
- Worth 375c per gram
- Worth 1125c per cubic centimeter
- Fragile
- Semi-Transparent

**PPH Alterations**
- **PPH Transference.** The PPH of Eathyst can be transferred to and from units of Eathyst, but it cannot be created using this process. When liquified, the Eathyst becomes agitated. If two liquified units of Eathyst are mixed, their puncture points merge together. If liquid Eathyst contacts solid Eathyst, the [[Gateways|gateway]] within the liquid will transfer to it, since it's more stable. However you do it, you can combine Eathyst PPH to create higher *grade* Eathyst. (See [[Ethology Reference Table]].)
- **PPH Increases.** The PPH of Eathyst increases very slowly with use. Most E-Tech only uses the Eathyst a couple times per hour due to the slower PPHs in common Eathyst, making this process mostly irrelevant to their tech. However, [[Ether Users]] constantly stimulate their Eathyst, making the process much faster and more integral to their development. 

**Eathyst Farming**
- **Near [[Gateways]].** Eathyst grows much faster around [[Gateways]]. The amount of Eathyst grown per day (in ft^3) is a number equal to half the diameter the nearby [[Gateways|gateway]] (in feet). I.E. a 2ft [[Gateways|gateway]] would produce 1ft^3 of Eathyst per day. A 6ft [[Gateways|gateway]] would produce 3ft^3 of Eathyst per day.
- **Near Weak Points in Spacetime.** A weak point is something extremely energy dense but not approaching reality bending levels, such as a supernova, or a neutron star. Eathyst without a [[Gateways|gateway]] accretes at a much lower rate. For every cubic meter of energy dense material, 1cm^3 of Eathyst secretes per day. This makes Eathyst naturally occurring, but remarkably rare.

### Eathyst Alloys
**Forming Eathyst Alloys**
	By mixing liquified Eathyst with another liquified metal, you can create an Eathyst alloy. Eathyst alloys have the physical traits of the metal, with the PPH of the Eathyst. The trick is to use small Eathyst with a high PPH to preserve as much of the metal as possible. 

**Conductors.** 
	Won't produce [[Ether and Unether|Ether]], but will function as an [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] conductor. [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] flows through the material, and follows it until it reaches a natural end. [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] has resistance and will cause heat build up if the circuit is unbroken, or if the amount of [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] is above the E-Copper's grade.

**Resistors / **Low Grade Conductors.** 
	Won't produce [[Ether and Unether|Ether]], but will function as an [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] resistor. Without a high grade to support the [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] flowing throw it, it actively slows it down and reduces the flow.

**Capacitors.** 
	Won't produce [[Ether and Unether|Ether]], but will function as an [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] battery. [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] directed inside of it is held indefinitely. Will leak [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] if exposed to electricity. If the amount of [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] stored is above its grade, it melts.

**4D Materials.** 
	The PPH of the Eathyst doubles due to bypassing local spacetime restrictions. I.E. the puncture point can get away with leaking much more [[Ether and Unether|Ether]].

**Non-Conductive Metals.** 
	The PPH of the Eathyst is halved, but it gains the physical properties of the metal.

### E-Tech
**The Basics**
	By making use of quantum computers and Eathyst alloys, it's possible to create a system that reliably produces an effect using [[Ether and Unether|Ether]]. The basic Eathyst device looks like this.
		1. **Programmer**. A computer that simulates brainwaves / intelligent thought to program the [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] for the desired effect. These signals are pushed into the power source.
		2. **Power Source.** The signal from the programmer passes into the power source, which then begins leaking the appropriately programmed [[Ether and Unether|Ether]].
		3. **E-Conductor.** To prevent the [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] from erupting from the Eathyst, the [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] from the power source is moved into an [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] conductive alloy.
		4. **Exit Point.** The [[Ether and Unether|Ether]] flows to its desired point, at which it begins to manifest.
