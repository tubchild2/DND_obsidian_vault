A star forge is a machine invented during the mid 11000s. It channels the power of a star into a central chamber, which then focuses it into a beam used for melting massive quantities of metal, destroying entire space stations, storing and selling in the form of stellar batteries, or for melting a couple grams of [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]].
