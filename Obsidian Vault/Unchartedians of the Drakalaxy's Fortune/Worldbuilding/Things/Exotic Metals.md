### Nethrium
**General Information**
- Can be found inside of 4D creatures
- Must be stored extremely carefully at high temperatures, as it can blind you or release ridiculous amounts of radiation.
- Appearance: solid black, with purple streaks through it. 
- Conductor.
- Noncorrosive. 
- Effective insulator. 

**Properties**
- Worth: ~285,300c / gram
- Worth: ~95,000c / cm^3
- Density: 3g / cm^3
- 4D.
	- It's true structure is beyond our plane of reality. 
	- Impossibly dense, leading to perfect energy distribution. I.E. indestructible and heat-resistant. 
	- Can only be destroyed by something impossibly hot, or by something else 4D
- Melts at 5,600c
- Boils at 150,000c
- Ionizes at 3,000,000c
