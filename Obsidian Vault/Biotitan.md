### General Information
The ultimate weapon. They're bioengineered monstrosities capable of accreting gargantuan amounts of [[Ether and Unether|Ether]]. Any semblance of free will has been chemically diluted, leaving behind a subservient beast with a forcibly implanted endoskeleton. Rods are driven lengthwise through its bones to allow complete control.

Has not yet been created, but the [[Armstrong Initiative]] has conceptualized it.
