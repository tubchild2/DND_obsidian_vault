He's taking a nuts and bolts approach. That means something.

## Chef vs Cook
Writing is hard to teach because you'll learn more than he can teach you by writing your first book.
You need to start exploring with your style, seeing how it goes, trying new things, revising.
You'll get better and better at using tools as you learn, and you'll know which tools to ignore.
Writing advice is only as good as its ability to help you individually. You'll get bad advice from him in this class.
Writing is very individual, and what works for some doesn't work for others.

Some are gardeners, and some are architects. Some build structures for their story and hang a story upon it. Others nurture something that starts to grow and see what it turns into. You need to figure out what your style is as you write,  you'll fall somewhere between these two.

His philosophy is to treat each person like a chef, and not a cook. In his definition, a cook is someone that can follow a recipe to get what they're trying to make. If something goes wrong, cooks have no idea what went wrong. He doesn't know what specifically, happened, he just knows that things usually turn out. A chef is a person that can tell you what ingredients are and take the various styles of baking and apply them to their own process to make their own things. They use the knowledge of previous recipes. He wants us to be chefs. 

Learn all the tools and processes and try them. Your goals can be your own.

## Pro vs Non-Pro
It's wonderful to be a non-professional writer. Writing is good for you, so it doesn't matter if you're a pro or not. If you tell people about a book, people will ask you if you've published it. There are advantages to approaching writing from a utility-first mindset. You do need to ask those questions. However, utility isn't the primary purpose of art: it's making the artist's life more enriched / to make your life better by creating something. it's ok for them to ask that. But it's not why you should write. Writing is good for you. Expressing yourself is good for you. This class assumes you're in the category of wanting to make a full-time living as a sci-fi or fantasy novelist. He does that because all those other things' advice still is part of the aspiring professional. 

Realistically, making a living as a professional novelist or musician or fine artist is hard. Those jobs are difficult to make a living at. Writing copy is easier, but writing fiction is hard. It's not as hard as people say, or how much people think. He took this class, and there were 5 other people that went pro of around 30 people. It's like 1/20 to make money, 1/50 to be a pro.

If you're dedicated to this, and you're willing to invest time into this, you're much more likely to succeed. You just need to not give up. The odds are significantly better than people pretend. 

You need an aggressive writing schedule during your early years to learn your process. If you haven't made like 3 novels, your job is not to sell books, your job is to write enough books to learn your process. This could be bad advice because once and awhile there could be a stupid person who writes a great first book first try. It took him 14 to get his first good book.

You need to be practiced at consistently writing.

Your first books are learning your scales. This beautiful thing you're working on at first and cherishing might be ugly once you make it. Maybe your skill isn't up to your aspirations yet. You need to learn early on that you are the product of the time you spend writing. You'll get better at expressing your ideas and grow as a person. You get better as you write. 

## Tool Box

## Artistic Expression
While writing the book, you should be making the best decisions. You should be in control. Once you finish that book, there should be a second person that takes the manuscript and figures out every mercenary way to exploit that book for profit so that you can let the artist out so that they can try to be artistic again. You're the same person, and there's some things that you won't do as an artist with your book.

The business person shouldn't be in charge of your book. Don't compromise artistic integrity because of what the business person thinks. Sometimes you might have to. There's a back and forth between the business person and the artist. There's communication between the two sides, but the artist should make the artistic decisions and the business person should decide how to sell that book / dictate what the book should be. It might be bad advice.

Revision is a difficult skill to learn. Some of his friends who were making the best artwork were better revisers than they were writers. A lot of people's second books are publishable. Revision is an important thing to learn. He wrote 5 books and then didn't revise them for 7 years. Discovery writers over-revise. Revisers that constantly over-revise the early chapters don't tend to make it. **Having 80 first chapters doesn't get you far.** Learn revision, it's incredibly important.

## Motivation
What made Brandon Sanderson write. What gave him motivation? He saw that if he didn't write, he'd have to get a job he didn't like. Starting is hard, and some times he hits a rough patch. He loves the busywork of writing. He started keeping a spreadsheet of the amount he wanted to write each day, and if he hit his goal, he'd stop worrying about it. He made the progress, and he could go do something else. His goal was something like 1000 words. It worked for him like levelling up in an MMO.

Survivorship bias is our brains are more likely to weigh the words of someone who's successful even their success was random. We can't say what contributed to Brandon's success. He's a survivor of the system working.

Brandon almost giving up. He's getting rejected from multiple grad schools. He had written at the time about 12 novels. He hadn't sold any. His father gave him father speak about being concerned. His parents were worried that he was going to end up begging for money. They were kinda right, **having a backup plan is a very good idea.** He had no backup plan. He got into a college, and he didn't know what he was doing with his life. He didn't think he could write books and get a job as a professor. He didn't know what to do. He didn't honestly want to stop writing because that's what he likes to do. If he's 90 and he never sells a book, than he's still a success in his eyes. Grimdark wasn't his thing and that's what was popular at the time. Publishers don't like long books very much. They wanted something short and grimdark, and he was the worst for them. He wrote long hopeful epics with 30 magic systems. He was told to read GOT and write something like that. He decided that he's gonna write what he wanted to write. He wrote the way of kings, and as he was writing that, Elantris sold. 

You can write multiple books in the same setting. It might be a gambit. Writing all in the same world without making them sequels is probably the best of both worlds.

Get the first book out of the way and get back to the world you want to write later.

Ideas are cheap. The ability to take ideas and make them great is what people are looking for. 
- 1: Ideas are cheap
- 2: No they're not
- 1: Give me your 2 worst ideas
- 2: Pokemon meets the lost roman legion and Jim Butcher wrote the code of selaria which made a buttload of money.

Find some idea that works and jam some things together. 
Ideas are really cheap!

Last question: How do you get to a point of rewriting a story. How do you force yourself to rewrite.
He hates revision. It's his least favorite part. It's his strength. Learn whether you respond to carrots, sticks, or something else. Find what motivates you and use it. Group something you don't wanna do with something you have to do so that it becomes a habit.

Your job as a new writer is to figure out what triggers your mind to make these things work. An outline for your revision might help. Make a buglist with all of your biggest bugs and work your way down to the next bugs.

## Writing Groups
Latin-Germanic words sound more important to us. Surrender sounds more upper class than "I give up."

Taking feedback is important for the majority of writers. It's a good tool to try.

When he took this class in 1999, he made a writing group. Dan and him became pros. Peter became a full-time editor. They are 3 of the 4 people from that class that became pros. Ben was a Computer Science guy but he was cool. Pick out people who are most likely to make it.

Success breed success. 

Groups aren't for everyone, but they can be helpful.

Rules for picking writing groups
- If you're a discovery writer, be careful about taking advice until after you've finished discovering it. Stephen King is a discovery writer, and he hates outlines. Try not to submit too early. If you do, be aware of what can happen if someone hijack your book. Romance --> Vampires --> Thriller
- If you're getting feedback, try not to say anything. Try to be a fly on the wall. You don't want your audience to be aware of what you're planning to do. If you defend yourself and ask too many questions, you won't get authentic feedback. You'll ask questions now and then. He throws out like a third of the feedback he gets.
- Be descriptive, not prescriptive. Describe the piece's impact on you, don't try to fix their book. Show them what you're authentically feeling. "I liked this, I didn't like this, I didn't connect here, I felt this here." etc.
