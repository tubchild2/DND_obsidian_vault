### Postmodernism
Culture: how we give meaning to the world, to what is real, to what it means to be human.

Premodern culture: artists saw reality and represented it around how they viewed culture, which, in their case, largely meant religion.

Modern culture: imitations of reality brought about via consumerism lessened interest in religion, and made culture more vague.

Postmodern culture: mass produced media bombards us, and has become so self-referential that it's all copies of an original that doesn't exist anymore. We can't differentiate simulation from reality, and in that, they've become the same thing. There's no sense of truth, since any interpretation can be correct.


## Levels of Simulacra
Reality. Sincere, and true.
- House

Simulation. A copy of reality.
- Replica House

Simulacrum. Masking of the absence of reality. Losing tethers to the original.
- Moving people into the house without telling them about the original

Hyperreality. Complete loss of separation from reality. A copy without an original anymore. The distinction between reality and fiction blur to the point in which it doesn't matter, or the fiction is more real.
- Destroying the original house


## Types of Irony
Sincerity. Basic reality.
- I like bears.

Dramatic Irony. The audience has information the character doesn't.
- John held his teddy bear, unaware of the mama teddy bear watching him through his bedroom window.

Situational Irony. Expecting one thing, but something else happening instead.
- "I sure do love bears" said John, entering the cave full of hungry bears.

Verbal Irony. Saying something clearly contrary to your opinion to make your opinion more apparent.
- "Oh yeah, as you can clearly tell from my outfit I just *despise* bears," John said while gesturing to his bear themed t-shirt.

Satire. Exaggerating a contradiction in reality as both criticism and for comedic effect. A point through a layer of irony.
- John began to do his impression of bear haters. He stood on the table and said, "let's melt the ice caps! I hate forests and just *love* oil and pollution!"

Post Irony. Returning to sincerity after taking people through a layer of irony.
- Bears are starving so *clearly* the best move to make is to give them all of our food so that we starve and they don't. This would actually greatly benefit areas such as the pacific northwest, which has been facing rapidly declining bear populations due to global warming.

Meta Irony. Pointing to something in a way that prevents getting to the actual point of what you're saying; It's the point where irony and sincerity are muddled. 
- "As you can see, I have strong opinions about bears," said John, while holding a small statue of a dog.
- Cow Tools.

Hyper Irony. Irony that has lost meaning to the point that any of the options could be true. All meanings are true/false.
- A sign that says, "I am unopinionated about bears" posted on every surface in a city. Does he care about bears? Why would he do this if he doesn't? Is it a joke? What does it mean?
