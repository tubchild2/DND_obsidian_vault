Don't Show the Monster / Fear of the Unknown
	Let people imagine what scares them most, because that's scarier than whatever you come up with. The less information people have about what is going on, the better. Build up questions you might not answer. They don't know how to react because they don't know what the issue is.

Terror vs Horror
	Terror is a sense of being creeped out. You don't know if you're safe or not. You're filled with dread.
	Horror is when you see something that you know is dangerous, so you become scared. 
	Terror is better in most cases, because horror fades and can miss, and terror doesn't.

Tension + Fear
	To make something scarier, add something tense to the situation. For instance, having a spooky monster inch closer isn't that scary. However, having to decipher a puzzle on a time limit while the monster inches closer is much scarier, because there's an element of tension.

Disempowerment
	Make people feel vulnerable, weaker, and like they lack power. Feel like you're in actual danger.

Immersion
	Ambience and feeling immersed in the setting is important. That's what breaks a lot of horror movies; having protagonists make unrealistic decisions. The audience thinks, "oh that's stupid," which pulls them out of the movie because they no longer feel immersed in the decision that character made.
