# The Three Elements of a Story
There are 3 main elements of a story: plot, setting, and character. Conflict runs in between all 3, meaning that you should design them all to facilitate said conflict. 


# Plot
Plot is challenging to innovate in, because people expect certain things in a satisfying story, and subversions can be upsetting. It's fine not to innovate with plot if the setting and characters are innovative. Hamlet and the Lion King are the same plot, but with different settings and characters.

Big P Plot is what your story is about. It's the larger story that the whole book covers.
Little P Plot is what happens chapter by chapter to keep the reader engaged. 

**Promise**
A promise is an expectation of what is to come in the book.
- Don't stress about this when first starting a book. This can be done significantly easier in retrospect, and the first 3 or so chapters are incredibly easy to rewrite. 
- Takes place during your first few chapters, when someone decides whether to keep reading or not.
- These are very important.

Promises you should make
- Tone promise. Establish what kind of story the reader is getting into, and the kind of feel it will have. You can do this with a prologue if the first few chapters are unique. If you plan multiple tones, demonstrate them in little ways in the beginning.
- Plot promise. Demonstrate what the plot is going to be like in a small way. You can do this with a cold open (mini story at the beginning), a metaphor for the main conflict, a time skip, a prologue, or some other way of demonstrating the Big P Plot. 
- (Series Exclusive). Promise something big at the end, promise the continued self-contained adventures of one character, or set up what to expect from future installments.
- (Chapter Exclusive). Include a stealth thesis paragraph to set up what the chapter will be about.

**Progress**
You control progress in your story to a greater extent that you think. You can give the characters everything they want, so the important thing is pacing. You need to make progress feel earned so it's not a Deus Ex Machina, and you need to make progress happen regularly enough so that chapters aren't just filler.

How fast do you want the progress to be? How do you want the story to be paced? What kinds of progress will they make? How will you signpost that to the reader?

Match the type of progress you choose to what your climax is going to be. Stories typically have multiple of these happening at once, so identify the one most important to your story.
- If you're writing a mystery, and the climax will be an informational reveal, have progress be tied to information.
- If you're writing something that ends with a swordfight, show them getting better at swordfighting, or show them progressing further with their encounters with the BBEG.


**Payoff**
The payoff is simply giving people a surprising yet inevitable fulfillment of the promises. Give success  plausible deniability with things like escalating obstacles or red herrings. 

Twists need to work with the promises made earlier, but they should still subvert expectations. One way to do this is to overdeliver on the promise, or to promise one thing and slowly show how cool something else is, and then give them that second thing.


# Setting
Setting is far and away the easiest place to innovate.

Great worldbuilding with bad plot and bad character is just an encyclopedia. Worldbuilding is important, but great worldbuilding cannot save a sequence that doesn't make progress or have bad characters.


# Character
Character falls right in the middle of innovation difficulty; it's easier than plot, but harder than setting.
