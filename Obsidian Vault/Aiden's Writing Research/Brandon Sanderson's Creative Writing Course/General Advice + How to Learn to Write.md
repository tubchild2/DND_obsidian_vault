**Writing Your First Novels**
- This will teach you more than anything else.
- Your early years should focus on writing 3 novels to learn your process.
- Your early ideas that you love might be ugly once you make them.
- Don't revise the first few chapters over and over.

**Getting Advice**
- Advice is only as good as its ability to help you individually.
- What works for some won't work for others.
- You want to be a chef, not a cook; you want to understand the tools and mechanics of a story rather than following a set recipe.
- Take in and experiment with as many tools and processes as you can. 
- Just because someone was successful doesn't mean their advice is good.

**Writing Styles**
There are two common approaches, and most fall somewhere between these extremes.
- Discovery Writing / Gardeners. You begin a story and see what it grows into by nurturing it.
- Outline Writing / Architects. You build a structure for your story and hang a narrative upon it.
Essentially, you need to learn what works for you through practice.

**Motivation**
- Keep a spreadsheet of how much writing you want to get done per day.
- Maybe 1000 words per day.
- Carrots, sticks, or something else. Find what works for you.
- Tie it to something you're already in the habit of doing.

**Other**
- Explore with your style
- Try new things
- Become practiced at consistently writing
- The businessman shouldn't make the artists' decisions, and vice versa.
- Have a backup plan if you pursue this full-time.
- Ideas are cheap
- Things that break the rules or subvert expectations have a harder time getting reader's attention, but once they do, they typically have a much stronger grip. Additionally, red marks give you access to a lot more tools that you couldn't do otherwise. Pros and cons.
