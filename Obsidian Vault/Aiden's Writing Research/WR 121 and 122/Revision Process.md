### Step By Step
Step 1: Think Globally
	Step back from your writing to view the big picture. What are you trying to say, and are you doing a good job at communicating that? Go through each point you make and analyze it.

Step 2: Sweat the Small Stuff
	Word choice, sentence structure, grammar, style, and other things like that are still very important!

Step 3: Read Your Own Writing
	Writers are often too close to their own text to know what it says. Find ways of stepping back from your text to gain some critical distance. Read from the perspective of someone who knows nothing about what you’re talking about.

Step 4: Peer Review
	Have other people of differing perspectives criticize your work.

Step 5: Source Check
	Check your quotes. Develop a deep familiarity with the sources. Then, make sure that your examples, statistics, quotes, evidence, stories, etc. actually support the point you're making with them.

Step 6: Keep Asking "As Opposed to What?"
	Include what "they say" all the time. Enter into a conversation. Show what others think on matters.

Step 7: Move it up!
	The more important the point, the more it needs to be moved to the "top" of the piece, where it'll better get your reader's attention and infuse all you say that follows.

Step 8: Repair "Uh Oh" Moments
	If you take your argument in the wrong direction, or have unanticipated implications, experiment with different solutions and turn them into your advantage.

Step 9: Clean Up
	Don't let the mess show. Create user-friendly, readable text. Coherent, unified, concise, etc. When you find an error, try to correct it, and try to make it look like it never existed. If you find something you can't fix, remove it!
