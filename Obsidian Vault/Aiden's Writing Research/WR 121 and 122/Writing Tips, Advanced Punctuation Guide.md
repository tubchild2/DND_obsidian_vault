### Writing Tips
- Cut Adverbs
- Vary Sentence Length
- Keep Writing Concise
- For MLA formatting, go to OWL Purdue University's MLA formatting/style guide. Use MLA citation makers.
- Use Ethos, Pathos, or Logos. *Mostly* focus on one and use it as efficiently as possible.
	- Ethos. Listen to me because of who I am, and because of my credibility / my sources credibility. Cite people because you have no ethos to start! Build your credibility and prevent plagiarism. This one should always be supported even if it isn't the focus, since you don't want to look unprofessional. 
	- Pathos. Listen to me because of the way this point makes you feel. 10 puppies will die.
	- Logos. Listen to me because what I say makes sense logically.
- They Say / I Say. Enter a broader conversation. Summarize what they say without twisting or listing their points, and state how your view differs and why.
- Include effective transitions between paragraphs

### Punctuation
- Commas ( , ). Separate ideas like a pickaxe. Think of it like this, “if the clause separated by the comma can be moved around in the sentence, then it’s correct. If not, then get rid of the comma.” For example, the first clause in this sentence can be moved to the end and it'd still work.
- Semicolons ( ; ). Link two independent sentences together with a little bit of glue. They imply a connection between sentences.
- Colons ( : ). Link two independent sentences together with a strong connection. They also work as a drum roll, “I hate one person more than anyone else: Brian Chunderson!” It's like saying they're linked and don't function without each other.
- Em Dashes ( -- ). Function as pretty much anything! Don’t overuse them, because they’re less professional.
- Hyphen ( - ). A short dash that connects two words together at the **end of a line of text.**
