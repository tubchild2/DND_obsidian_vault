## How to Create an Embarrassing Secret
Step 1: Pick a Taboo
- A taboo is something generally frowned upon by the public.
- Find something that's in the sweet spot between mild and extreme. It should cause you to squirm in your seat and make you not want to admit writing it. It shouldn't cross IRL lines though.
- It should make people say "oof" or "yikes" if they read it.

Step 2: Make it Real
- Play it up
- Add too much detail
- Make it believable
- If you can, tie it to another player

Step 3: Justification
- Why is your character doing this?
- How does your character justify doing this in their heads?
- How are they planning on defending themselves?

- Filming yourself doing nude yoga
- Keeps a diary in which they imagine themselves married to another crew member
- Records themselves sobbing in the bathroom while doused in green paint
- An in-depth series of notes about a male crew member with breast implants
