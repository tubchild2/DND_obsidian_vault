Stories are built
- Plot
- Setting
- Character
The intersection of the 3 is conflict
You want to create that conflict. All should exist to create or facilitate the conflict because that's what your story is about.

The purpose of plot:
- Category 1: Big P Plot. What is your book about? Quick summary of the major story. Bigger problems.
- Category 2: Little P Plot. What happens chapter by chapter to keep the reader engaged. Smaller problems resolving.

Plot is for
1. Facilitate conflict
2. Give reader some structure that a story is being told and that it is moving along

Setting is the easiest place to innovate. Character second easiest. Plot is the most difficult.

People expect things in a satisfying story. If you subvert them, people could get upset. In general, you'll want to tell a satisfying story. Innovating in plot isn't something that needs to be done. If you're combining plot with interesting setting and character, you'll create something that's gonna read and feel fresh and unique. It doesn't matter that Dune is Hamlet is the Lion King. The plot is the same but you wouldn't ever compare them. You can use plot as a tool. It should be one of those things where the chef knows what works and can use it with only taking pieces and parts.

Plot breaks down to this idea of promise, progress, and payoff. You can do this while discovery writing. The difference between discovery writers and outline writers (most fall in between), most people spend amount the same amount of time writing in total. These are handy tools for analyzing stories that have gone wrong. Don't worry or think you have to learn all of this upfront. Writing will teach you how to do this than anything else will. Use them as analytical tools.

Even outliners discovery write because outlines aren't perfectly detailed.

Don't keep revising your first chapters. Wait until you finish the book.

## Promise
Promises are the easy one. Don't stress promises at the beginning of the book. Once you have the core of your book done, you can throw away 3 chapters to nail what your promise should do. That's easy. Throwing away 40 chapters in the middle is hard. They're the easiest but most important. Rarely do first lines actually matter. It's your first couple of pages. A zinger of a first line can be great. Having one is worth doing. But really, your first chapter are important cause that's when someone is going to decide whether someone wants to keep reading. A lot of people rely on the title. You can get away in sequels because you don't start it until you trust him.

If you have a big series, it can be handy to make one of the kinds of promises:
- This is a large continuing story and there's something big at the end
- Here are 7 sisters
- Here are the continuing self-contained adventures of this character

Promises you should be worrying about now (not all innately obvious).
- Make a tone promise. A tone promise is a way to tell the reader the kind of story they're getting into, and that this is the kind of feel it will have. If it's a comedy, put jokes early on. If it's grimdark, put tragedy early on. Prologues are great because you can introduce what the story is going to be like immediately, even if the tone and world and all that start off different. In Star Wars, Luke is a farm boy at the beginning, so they have a prologue showing a space wizard killing people with a lightsaber. If you are going to be switching tones, promise both tones in the beginning.
- Make a promise of what the plot is going to be. Some use a cold open / in medias res, which is a mini story at the beginning to demonstrate the story in a small way. Introduce some metaphor for the main conflict. Sometimes your main conflict won't come for awhile. They likely won't discover the big conflict for awhile. What the character wants and why they can't have it. Start there and throw the capital P plot at them. A small snapshot of the large picture. This can be done pretty easily in retrospect which is why many people rewrite the early chapters. You can also do a flashforward as a prologue. In short stories, you need to hit these much harder and much faster.

Rule of thumb: things that break the rules have a bigger threshold to overcome to grab the reader's attention, but once they do, they tend to hold onto it harder. Romance novels don't typically subvert and once someone reads them that's that, but when they do, they take off and get bigger. Your job isn't to get rid of everything that would make someone put a book down, your job is to get rid of all the ones that aren't integral to the piece of art you're making, and try to rely on the ones that are integral as ways to distinguish it. You can do things with red marks that you couldn't do with anything else. Some weaknesses are serious strengths if you know how to use them, and they let you do things you couldn't do otherwise.

Most chapters start with a stealth thesis paragraph that set up what the chapter is going to be about. 

## Progress
The most important of them all. You absolutely control progress in your story to a greater extent than you think. At any point in your story, you could make the plot progress. At any point Tolkien could write, "Frodo teleported to mount Doom and destroyed the ring." Deus Ex Machina is when plot progresses too fast and it doesn't feel earned. Filler is the opposite, when something happens and it isn't important.

Your job as a writer isn't to make things progress, it's to give a sense of satisfying progression by deciding a couple things:
- How fast is the progress? How will the story be paced? Match it to the story and to your own writing style. What kinds of progress will they make? How will you signpost that to the reader?
- There are lots of different types of progress. Whatever you choose, match it to what your climax is going to be. That means, if you're writing a mystery, and the end is going to be an informational reveal, make progress tied to information. If you're writing a story that'll end with a gunfight with BBEG, maybe progress tied to surviving encounters with the BBEG and getting better at dealing with them. These things are signposted to the reader. A relationship story like a buddy cop story that ends with the relationship working out, progress is going to be tied to them drawing closer with maybe some back steps along the way (literally the Other Guys). When they finally get together, that's your climax. Stories often have multiple of these happening at once, so identify which is the most important to your story. GOTG did this by having the relationship climax and the actual climax resolved together at once. Your big P plot in GOTG is get the McGuffin, but the little p plot is about the characters and their relationships. A page turner is usually a story that really understands progress.

Great worldbuilding with bad plot and bad character is just an encyclopedia. Worldbuilding is important, but great worldbuilding cannot save a sequence that doesn't make progress or have bad characters.

## Payoff
Payoffs are really just giving people a surprising yet inevitable fulfillment of the promises. The twist can make it surprising, you can also give them plausible deniability. You worry and you wonder if the character is actually going to succeed. Escalating obstacles and maybe some red herrings to make people think they might not get what they want in the end.

Twists are great because when you forget your promise and then come back to it it's really interesting. You promise that Gandalf is going to show up on the morning of fifth day, and then forget about it during the awful battle, and then they show up and it's surprising. It's a twist that makes sense because it was set up later. This is magical when it works.

One thing you can do to make a twist is to overdeliver. Promise a toy car, give a real car. Another thing is promising a toy car, then show them how cool planes are over the course of the story, and then give them a toy plane.
