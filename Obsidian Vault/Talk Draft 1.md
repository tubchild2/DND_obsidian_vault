"I think it's weird for me to be doing this too"

Prophecy is a fascinating part of the Bible that is incredibly important to us on a day to day basis and Jehovah's Witnesses. It can also be either incredibly straightforward, or near indecipherable without assistance from some other resource. I personally found Isaiah to be so complex that I probably wouldn't have gotten much of anything from it without the study guide. So that's a strange dilemma to have. It's incredibly important, but if someone maybe out in the ministry asked you to define it, you might be a little stumbled. So, how do you define prophecy? Well, what's the ultimate authority on Bible prophecy? The Bible. So, we're going to be looking at a few verses to learn what Prophecy is, and how it occurred. 



**WHAT IS PROPHECY**
Paragraph Formula:
- Question
- Introduce a scripture
- Explain the scripture
- Illustrate the scripture / Joke
- Make practical value clear
Content
- Prophecy is a message inspired by God: a divine revelation.
- Prophecy doesn't have to involve foretelling the future
- There are many examples of prophecies not foretelling the future

So, what is prophecy? If you could open your Bibles to 2 Peter 1:20, 21, we can see the Bible's answer. 2 Peter 1:20, 21. It says, "For you know this first, that *no* prophecy of Scripture springs from any *private interpretation*. For prophecy was at *no time* brought by *man's will*, but men spoke *from god* as they were moved by holy spirit." Did you notice what it said? It said that prophecy wasn't brought by man's will, but that it came from god. So, the straight definition for prophecy is: a message inspired by God. A prophet, therefore, is someone who receives this message from God and shares it with others. 

Note that it doesn't say that prophecy *must* involve foretelling the future. I didn't know that at first because most of the prophecies I'm very familiar with are prophecies about the last days in Revelation 21, and ones about historical events like Cyrus capturing Babylon in Isaiah. The Bible actually contains several instances of divine revelations that didn't foretell the future. Let's see an example at Luke 22:63, 64. To set the scene, Jesus had just been sentenced to death, and some men around him were hitting him. Luke 22:63, 64. It says, "Now the men who held Jesus in custody began to mock him, hitting him; and after covering his face, they kept asking: "Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?" Now these cruel men were asking Jesus to prophecy, but they weren't asking him who would hit him, they were asking who had hit him. Past tense. Meaning that it wouldn't involve foretelling the future.
