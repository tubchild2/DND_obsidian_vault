Tools for making a hollow knight inspired story:
- Communicate the story through atmosphere, visuals, dialogue, and small details. This makes the world feel vast, mysterious, immersive, and emotionally rich.
- Create a somber, quiet, and beautifully sad aesthetic.
- Give characters limited appearances, sincerity, and believability. 
- Use a unique premise and flesh it out.
- Stack the odds against the protagonist in a believable, slow-burn way.

World:
- Somber / Quiet / Lonely
- Beautifully Tragic / Emotionally Rich
- Detail Oriented
- Mysterious
- Immersive

Adrift in space in a space station taken over by a vast ecosystem of creatures, some of which are hostile. It's largely unexplored, and lonely. The only way out are the remaining escape pods on the top deck, but they've been overtaken by the heart of the ecosystem.

The Werewolf was a space station that houses 8 Class-10 ships (max capacity of 880). It's such a large station, that entire cities could fit within it. It was constructed to house a bioengineered creature called "the Heart" which could produce water, and custom biomass on command (be it plant or flesh). It was mistreated by those on board, and lashed out, breaking apart the station and flooding it with water and voracious animals. 

None on board believe there's any hope of escape. The survivors have come to terms with it and now live a self-sufficient life. From the inside, it doesn't appear like they're in space, more like a dark network of lush caverns of varying kinds.

Deep below deck, in the roots of the ship, a creature is born of the heart. However, it has sentience. It wants freedom, and in order to get it, it must slay the heart and free the ship. But can it?


Gameplay:
- Wake up.
- Your goal is immediately established to be escape.
- You're in a lush cavern deep underground.
- You notice some cavern walls recede just enough to show concrete, or metal plates. 
- There are signs displaying directions in bold, worn, deep colors, suggesting intelligent life.
- As you climb your way through the wilds, you discover hundreds of skeletons that have been picked clean.
- Creatures with black eyes are aggressive and stronger, but the rest of them are simply territorial or pacifistic.
- You encounter other humans that speak of a tragedy many generations ago bringing to ruin what was.
- You find a large settlement that was once home to humans, but has been claimed by nature.
- The purposes of whatever location you're in seem to have been scientific in nature, specifically bioscience.
- Some black tendrils are running through the ship and causing the creatures to develop black eyes.
- The black tendrils can affect plants, and can create new creatures, all of which are very aggressive. 
- The tendrils run from "the heart," some kind of source at the top of the ship near the exits.
- The citizens don't believe there's any way out.
- The closer you are to the heart, the more organic everything looks, but you can find sections that haven't yet been affected by the heart. This allows you to find the window, which shows the outside world. There's nothing but empty space, meaning that whatever structure you're on is some kind of massive space station.
- You can confront and kill the heart, and doing so allows you to access the escape pods and earn your freedom.
