Part 1: Recap
- Recap where we left off.
- Everyone is back on the ship. It's the next day, and the shipwright finally finished tuning the last few bits of your ship. *Hopefully, this is enough of a hint to get them to want to go to the coordinates*
- They can grab what they want to bring, and prepare for the voyage ahead.
- They're currently in sector 18 of [[Vivere Mori]] in [[Vivere Mori|Viviris]] Valley. They have a large map of [[Vivimus]] that they stole from the distraught map selling lady in [[Vivere Mori]]. 


Session Goal:
They can go wherever they want. They'll probably just go straight to [[Beholder's Reach|Wyrm's Rest]] though.
