Session Focus: The mysterious coordinates left behind by [[Pluto]]. Dungeon on [[Vivimus]]. 
1. The coordinates are primarily underground. They can fly their new ship to the cave entrance. 
2. The cave takes heavy inspiration from Super Metroid and Nausicaa. Very alien, and unknowable. Huge glowing organic structures you can't measure or comprehend, creatures with counterintuitive designs, creatures with extra eyes, arms, and tentacles, skinny creatures, creatures missing important features, creatures with unnaturally tough skin, unnatural terrain formations, places that suggest intervention despite not having it, etc. 
3. [[Pluto]]'s Dungeon is 2000 years old, and carved from ancient stone. After working through the cave, they've climbed to a point closer to the surface. It's a massive dungeon, with elegant designs and elaborate traps / puzzles. [[Vivimus]]' ecology has moved in, causing these phenomena:
	1. The dungeon is split into two sections separated by a chasm. 
	2. Some rooms are completely overgrown with [[Fernites]].
	3. A section of the dungeon is infested with horrible monsters.
	4. A few rooms have chemical canals running through them.
	5. One room is full of heavy toxic gasses. 
4. The boss room has a very large monster that takes inspiration from Super Metroid and Nausicaa. They're given better weapons, and access to the innermost chamber.
5. The innermost chamber sets up the hunt, as well as many mysteries. 
	1. How [[Pluto]]'s men entered [[Manor Galling]].
	2. What [[Pluto]] *actually* stole / what the [[Tessali]] *really* is. 
	3. Why the heist went wrong.
	4. What [[House Galling]] wants with the treasure.
	5. What happened to [[Pluto]] after he got the treasure.
