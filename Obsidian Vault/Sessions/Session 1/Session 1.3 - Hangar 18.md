**Opening Monologue**
- As your ship hurtles through the void, the red planet [[Vivimus]] grows larger, slowly consuming your entire field of view. Its surface is a haunting expanse of volatile chaos, a world teetering on the edge of decay.
- You pierce through a heavy, dry haze of crimson clouds that stretch endlessly across the sky. The ship shudders under the turbulence, buffeted by searing winds. As you descend, the alien terrain unfolds beneath you—a volcanic, rust-streaked wasteland of hostile beauty. Needlelike mountains splinter the burnt-orange skyline, their jagged peaks silhouetted against the bloated red sun. The sun itself hangs like a dull, angry orb, its harsh rays slicing through the haze, scattering deep shadows across the landscape.
- Below, rivers of molten magma carve violent paths down the hillsides, their fiery flow vanishing into swirling storms of ash and dust. The ground is scarred with charred and shattered bones, their jagged forms jutting from the earth like a grim forest. Nearby, plumes of toxic gas hiss and sputter from cracked chemical vents.
- Through the haze, a massive silhouette emerges—dark, oppressive, and unnatural. As you approach, the outline sharpens into mountainous black walls, impossibly tall and unyielding, stretching beyond the limits of your vision. Above the walls, the faint curve of a colossal glass dome becomes visible, shimmering dimly under the corrosive winds.
- At the base of the wall, barely visible at first, is a single black tunnel—a needle-like opening cutting through the unyielding steel. Your ship angles down and enters, swallowed by the tunnel’s gaping maw. 
- After 20 seconds, you fly out the other end of the wall and are greeted by a massive cliff-face that towers above you, and drops deeper than you can see. There are some smaller walls with watchtowers, and a small checkpoint to allow you to park your ship and enter the city.
- You fly inbetween two metal towers, and an barrier of arcing electricity blocks your path. To your left, you can see a large grimy window in the tower. Through it, you spot the silhouette of a figure--the checkpoint officer--watching your approach.


**Checkpoint 18**
- You see an older **Tortle** leaning back in a battered swivel chair. He squints through thick, fogged-up glasses, his gaze sharpening as he peers into your cockpit. After a moment, he reaches for his radio with a sigh, his weathered hands fumbling with the dials before sending a crackling signal to your ship. The radio buzzes to life, and you begin to hear him ringing your ship. 
	- His name is Gordon
	- He's 102.
	- He's been working as a checkpoint officer for 60 years.
	- He despises [[Vivimus]], and hates [[Vivere Mori]] even more.
	- He's a few months from retiring. He wants to go and meet another Tortle and settle down. 
	- His ex-girlfriend was crushed by a falling statue in the city when he was 20
	- He lives in the tower and is responsible for everyone coming in and out. He'll take shifts as the shipwright with his partner every once and awhile.
	- He's good friends with the main shipwright, Chav Cymbeline. He's kind of a tool but they're friends anyways.
- He says, "Hello, welcome to [[Vivere Mori]]. I need to ask you a few questions before I can let you in the city. Nothing to worry about--standard procedure."
	- Please state your name, rank, and intention.
	- Who's your current employer? 
		- If they say [[House Galling]]. "Shocker."
	- What's your business in [[Vivere Mori]]?
	- Where are you coming from?
		- [[The Deadwoods]] are the worst this time of year. You guys seem to go to the worst locations, but hey that's [[House Galling]] for you. 
	- Are you planning on exploring the surface?
		- Listen, I can't intervene in any actions you take beyond letting you in and out of the city. But... outside these walls is nothing but chaos and death. In the 60 years I've run this checkpoint, I've seen countless people try their luck and die out there. Just... make sure you're ready for what's out there.
	- Alright, you're approved for city entrance. I told you it wasn't so bad. Before you go, though, just... be careful alright? You seem like a decent bunch, but this isn't the kind of place you mess around in. There are certain groups you avoid, and they're all here. Keep your heads down, keep out of trouble, and watch your back. Good luck out there kids.  
- He deactivates the barrier and you fly forward into the Hangar. 
# Hangar 18 (Act 1)
- You see some concrete platforms extending from the cliff-side with roman numerals marking parking spots. A red hobgoblin exits his office in the cliff and begins waving your ship onto the first spot. You hear a loud clunk and some rattling as the landing gear engages, and the ship parks itself. What do you do?
- As you're walking out, you see the hobgoblin examining your ship. He's squinting at some things, poking around, and then he effortlessly pulls a bolt out of the exterior of your ship and lets out this forced, wheezy, drawn out laugh. "I don't understand [[House Galling]]'s insistence on these crappy 30 year old ships. If you guys ever want an upgrade, let me know. Entrance into the city is through that door." He points to a circular door in the cliff side. 
	- He's named Chav Cymbeline. He's brash, bold, selfish, and loves the city, the violence, the greed, the action, and the abundance of customers. He got a bionic eye because his original eye was gouged out in combat. 
		- He'll let them design it now with graph paper. 
		- He says he'll have to put them ship through the system, so they should come back later to pay. He gives them a pager to let them know when their ship will be done. It'll be 100,000 credits, so make sure they have the money.
			- 100 gold / 1,000 silver / 10,000 copper / 100,000 credits
			- If they offer him silver he scoffs, then gets offended. 
				- "What is this? Is this a joke? You think because I'm a hobgoblin I use CSG currency? You think because I have eye implants I can't tell what's what? That's pretty racist man."

### Introductory description
As you enter the hangar, you hear shouting in the distance. You peer over some boxes, and spot the shipwright and checkpoint officer tied to your ship's landing gear. Your ship looks trashed. Well... more trashed. It's been absolutely torn apart.
You see men in black Gis and covered faces. Their necks glowing with some kind of strange tattoo. They're dispersed throughout the hangar, going through crates and throwing stuff around. On a walkway near the towers, you see another new face, this one seems to be ordering the others around. Though you can't hear what he's saying, the face is unforgettable. This is the leader of the Yakuza. 

I'm going to need everyone to roll initiative
1. Create a new log
2. Roll for all the enemies times for the enemies
3. Create a list ordering the turns
4. Track each enemy's health and any conditions, and keep references to their statblocks

| 1     | Just a straight up dookie. Nothing else either, just a nice log neatly placed in a large crate.                                           |
| 2-5   | It's a shipment of expired food packets. They're apple flavored.                                                                          |

| 16-19 | You see wrapped plastic bags containing some kind of yellow powder (Overclock), as well as some delivery instructions from [[House Galling]]. |
| 20    | You find a strange device that seems to be a portable heat based radar.                                                                   |


### Enemies
**Yakuza Boss: Okawa Yoichi**
1. Orders his men to search for the [[Nethrium]]
2. (if detected) Attempts to negotiate. He says, "this is your ship isn't it?" He'll let them live if they simply give "it" up. "It" doesn't belong to them. He means the [[Nethrium]]. His men detected it as soon as this ship landed. 
3. (if rejected) He'll demand the [[Nethrium]] or he'll kill the checkpoint officer. He asks if they even know what it is. If they don't give it up, they won't just be messing with the Yakuza, but they'll be messing with [[House Galling]], and no one survives that. 
4. (if rejected) He shoots the checkpoint officer, then sends his men after those he's aware of. He starts shooting from a distance. 
5. (if his men die) He shoots the alcohol barrels and causes them to ignite. He continues shooting at them until they get up close. Then he uses his Katana.

### Conclusion
(if they defeated them)
The shipwright thanks them for saving his life. He says he's sorry about their ship, but he'll make them a new one on the house. 

That's where we'll leave it.
