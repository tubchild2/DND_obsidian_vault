- [[Vivere Mori]] Ambience by tubbs

### Opening Monologue of the Streets
**Script**
- Stepping into the lower levels of the city, you’re met with an oppressive wave of neon and grime. The streets are dim, lit only by humming neon signs and holographic ads that flash garish colors across the slick, oil-streaked pavement. Overhead, layers of pipes, catwalks, and monolithic structures blot out the sky, trapping the streets in perpetual darkness.
- The air is heavy with the stench of burnt chemicals and machinery, thick enough to choke on. Small groups of shadowy figures linger in the corners, their eyes glinting warily before they fade into the gloom. Every sound echoes—the distant hum of machinery, faint screams that stop as abruptly as they start, and the occasional hiss of gas vents.
- Trash and debris line the streets, piled high in mold and grime around the street's darker corners.
- Some of you may have been here before, for some of you it's your first time. But just by looking around you can tell this is a place where the strong thrive, the weak disappear, and every step could be your last. 
- Welcome, to [[Vivere Mori]]. (START THE MUSIC NOW)
- What do you want to do?
- (REMINDER) They're in the hangar exterior on flashpoint drive.
 
### Hangar (Exterior Only) - Flashpoint Drive
**Description**
- Looking around, you spot a blue phone booth and a lady selling maps. 
- You also see a little girl in a pink dress with a teddy bear. She's sitting on a chair and crying quietly to herself. No one around her is taking any note. 
**Phone Booth**
- Your feet crunch on broken glass as you enter the cramped neon lined phone booth.
- There's a strange looking telephone device in the center. You can call anyone you might have the phone number for. 
**Map Salesman**
- You walk up to the map salesman
- Bibiana Perpetua
	- Middle aged human woman
	- Has panic attacks
	- Visibly stressed and dejected.
	- Her friend Naomi was supposed to show up to work, but she's not responding to any messages. She said she had a meeting at that casino downtown, but was clearly lying about it. Naomi is a fire genasi. 
	- She doesn't want anyone to investigate, and if you keep asking questions she leaves.
- Map (5c) (There are a few spots marked, but you can go anywhere in the city)

### Aria Arpeggio - Ether Enclave
**Exterior**
- You see a line of buildings up against the city's outer wall, each with flickering neon signs hanging off them. You see Aria Arpeggio, a damaged, and cheap looking music shop that was hastily adorned with a neon lime sign depicting an electric guitar 
- A pure mercury canal flows sluggishly into the walls, its toxic sheen reflecting the dim, flickering lights of the streets. Along the bank, a rusted stake is driven into the ground, tethered to something unseen in the mercury. 
	- As you tug at the rope, it pulls free, revealing the bloated, lifeless body of a man, his skin mottled with the unmistakable signs of mercury poisoning. His eyes are wide open, staring blankly into the toxic stream.
**Interior**
- You step into a cramped, colorful room, filled to the brim with mismatched furniture and clutter. Hundreds of instruments hang haphazardly on the walls, some dusty, some broken, others still in decent shape. Piles of sheet music spill out of boxes, and neon signs flicker with quotes about music. The air smells of old vinyl and electric guitar strings.
- In the corner, a jukebox blares 80s rock classics, while a goblin assistant zips around, quickly grabbing items from the shelves. Behind a worn-out counter with a cash register, you spot a grizzled, gray-haired goblin with round glasses, wearing a vintage 1920s-style suit. 
	- Selin Whitaker; An artsy washed up Goblin musician. He loves music, and calls it the truest form of art in the world. His hair is turning gray, and he has circular glasses and an outfit that wouldn't be out of place on a 1920s American president, except worn out. He plays the electric guitar, and loves classical music. He was relocated to the lower levels by [[House Galling]] when they demolished his old store. 
- See [[Spins]]. 

### Cloak and Stagger - Caustic Corner
**Exterior**
- Ahead the casino dominates the skyline. It towers up, with cascading yellow neon and flashing lights. Muffled electronic music thuds faintly from the inside. The air reeks of alcohol and smoke. 
	- Could I get a perception check? DC10. If it succeeds, they see some graffiti in the alley nearby. It's in Japanese. It roughly translates to "Debts unpaid cost more than gold."
- Outside the entrance, a half-orc bouncer leans lazily against the doorframe. She spots you and sighs. At her feet you see a baby basilisk. It has 8 huge legs, tough chalky blue skin, a red spiked back, a massive tail, and huge dripping teeth strong enough to crush rock. It's looking a little bit worse for wear.
	- She can be bought. She doesn't like her job. She's sarcastic and rude.
	- She'll only let you in if you're on the list, if you're over 18, or if you bribe her.

**Interior**
- You guys walk in, and are immediately met with an overwhelming barrage of sensory input. A thick haze of smoke fills the air, swirling and dancing beneath the neon red lights. 
- The room is massive, and split into a couple sections. There's a seating area, slot machines, a table playing some kind of wagering game, a bar, and a backdoor to the side of the bartender. What do you do?
	- (Let them roleplay for a little while) Could I get a perception check from Gemini? Out of the corner of your eye you notice a [[Weapon Catalogue|Tanto]] (a Japanese knife) hanging in front of the back door. When you were in the Yakuza, people would use that as a warning against entering that room.
	- The bartender is named Chaz Grober. If you try to buy anything alcoholic, he sighs, pulls out a massive book, and asks for their species and age.
		- Finding a way to distract the bartender and enter the backdoor gives you this. Behind the door is a cramped hallway that it doesn't look like Taure can fit into. The hallway leads to a single metal door marked with the symbol of [[House Galling]]. 
			- Inside, you find a room constructed entirely from white tiles, and in the corner, you see a fire genasi slumped against the wall. She's lifeless, her eyes and mouth half-opened. Her clothes stretched and ripped. She died recently.

### Larry's Pawn Shop and General Store - Petroleum Pass
**Exterior**
- The building is an old garage with "Larry's Pawn Shop and General Store" painted onto the rusted garage door in yellow paint. There's a regular door off to the side, with a tinted window lined with razor wire. 
- There's a homeless sketch artist outside. He's a very old mute. He has a sign advertising sketches for 10c. 
	- You see the group, and behind you is a little girl in a pink dress with a teddy bear. 
		- If you turn around you you see her, and she's actually there. She runs away and starts crying. 
			- Trying to talk to her makes her hyperventilate and sob. She'll lead you to Cloak and Stagger
**Interior**
- Inside, you see hundreds of plastic tubs piled all the way up to the shockingly low ceiling. Taure has to crouch to fit inside. At the checkout, you see a skinny old man wearing some cheap clothes that are riddled with holes. 
	- Lawrence Dumaine. He lives alone, hasn't been doing great since Evelyn left him, and eats expired yogurt for all 3 meals since it's all he can afford. His daughter won't speak to him, since they both found out he wasn't her real father. 
- You can buy, sell, or appraise anything you want. 
	- A compass that points to the nearest edible item. He bought this from a fat gnome he met on his last visit to Proxima Centauri B. 
	- A [[Item Catalogue|stuffed Glorby]]. The Adventures of Glorby is an alien cartoon show popular on Kepler-22b. In each episode, Glorby faces a new bully who teaches him a new lesson about life. He uses his words to dismantle the situation, then engages the bully in gladiatorial combat. It's a different culture.
	- A [[Item Catalogue|universal translator]]. Handy, pretty new, he bought it on his most recent visit to mars. 
	- A [[Item Catalogue|portable library]] device. It resembles a flip-phone. It's pretty old. It was made back when the [[federation]] was trying to market the internet to the rest of [[the Galaxy]], who promptly denied it. 
	- A hoverboard that gets faster the louder the user screams. Created as a training toy for kids on a planet called [[Item Catalogue|Screamo-10]]. Scream endurance is important to their culture.  
	- A [[Item Catalogue|short range teleporter]]. It works once a day, and can teleport you up to 60ft. It was tinkered by some gnomes he met on a space station. It uses an enormous amount of energy because it uses FTL warp drive technology.  
	- A pair of boots for sinking in liquid mercury. He traded them from someone for some Venusian pottery a couple months ago. 
	- A [[Item Catalogue|ring of frostbite]]. Deals cold damage if worn too long. 
	- Moon shoes. Make you jump 20ft into the air. Unfortunately, you do still take 100% fall damage.
	- Bow and arrow. Only shoots where you want it to when you're blackout drunk.
	- [[Weapon Catalogue|Chekhov's Gun]]. It's a shockingly powerful revolver that's really old. However, no matter what Lawrence does, he can't get the dang thing to fire. It's 1c, since it's broken, but if you can fix it, he estimates it being powerful enough to vaporize someone. 
		- It gets loaded whenever observed. It then waits a long time, before shooting when it's most dramatic. Deals 5d20 damage, but cannot be controlled by the user. Can fire once per session at maximum, but typically waits through entire campaigns. No one knows where it came from, but it can fly and typically moves when not observed to follow it's owner. 
- If you show him the [[Nethrium]], he quietly gasps. He says to put it away. He says he doesn't want trouble, and tells them to leave. If they don't, he closes his shop and shuffles away. 
### The Obscura Athenaeum - Fumewood
**Exterior**
- It looks very out of place. It's cut from dark stone, and has a gothic design and barred windows. 
**Interior**
- You see a dark, primarily stone cut room with cobwebs stringing between the bookshelves. It doesn't look like this place is the most popular. 
- Elenore Brandt; A Verdan librarian. She has limited telepathy, is tired, and short-tempered. She's tall, ginger, has straight hair, and wears a business suit and glasses.
- You can ask the librarian for books on pretty much anything.

### Mercury Maw Armory - Isopropyl Parkway
**Exterior**
- Could I get a perception check?
	- Outside the building, you see a holographic display that's cycling through wanted individuals. Below their faces, it shows who they are, why they're wanted, what they're worth, who wants them, and other stuff like that. 
		- Kael Vyrik. Wanted by Cyron Systems for data theft. Last seen on Fumewood, exited The Obscura Athenaeum.  
	- The alley next to the shop is completely dark, and there's a vaguely human shape through the darkness. 
		- Investigating, you see it's a dead body. It's a shirtless man, soaked from the dripping gutters above. Across his chest, IOU is written in red marker. 
**Interior**
- You step inside, and it's a complete mess. It looks like it was recently robbed. Everything was knocked off the shelves, and then poorly reorganized into piles and bins. There's Japanese text spray painted onto the wall. 
	- The text translates to "Debtor" with a not so nice connotation. 
- At the counter, you see a skinny Thri-Kreen busily organizing things behind him. What do you do? 
	- See https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment for details on specific weapons. Improvise prices. Tell them it'll take him a second to check the handbook since he's new to this. 
		- Barbarians wear light and medium armor. However, they do have unarmored defense, which can be better if they have high CON and DEX. 
	- His name is Chaktha. He's very stressed and not qualified to run the shop. He's overwhelmed because of all the work he's been doing since his boss went missing and the shop was destroyed. He's just an apprentice.
