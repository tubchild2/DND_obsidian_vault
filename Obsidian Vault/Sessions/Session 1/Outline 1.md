# Prepwork:
- See [[Improved Character Creation Guide]] for Landon's character
- Have everyone choose an alignment
	- Good or evil means do you have social or antisocial tendencies?
	- Lawful or chaotic means do you have communal or independent tendencies? Do you think about systems and trying not to focus on the individual, or do you want to think about the individual, like just you or just someone else?
- Have everyone choose a last name
- Have everyone spend a little time on their characters
	- Traits / backstory / quirks
- Have everyone spend a little time on their agendas 
	- (wants / needs)
