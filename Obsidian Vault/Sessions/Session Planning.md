# Session Concepts
### The Vengeance of [[Dale Borland]]
**Date**: Session 5+

**Plot**:
He follows the tracks of [[the party]] onto the surface of [[Vivimus]]. He finds out about [[Pluto]]'s hunt and couldn't care less. He trails behind them, getting closer and closer. 

He encounters some of the people [[the party]] hurt on their mission and heals them. He has a long conversation with them about how their lives turned out, and about serving the greater good. He gives them a meal, a place to sleep, and then sets off to the next location. Some reformed villains offer to help him, but Dale refuses. Dale finally finds [[the party]], and wakes up early to prepare for the confrontation. 

He interrupts their mission, and sets up a calculated strike on [[the party]]. He sets up multiple traps, and has multiple escape plans and contingencies ready in case something were to go wrong. The entire confrontation is carefully established to put him at an absolute advantage. He's outnumbered, but they're outmatched. 

### The Secrets of the Miyamoto Fire
Investigating the assassins who were hired to burn down Gemini's home, and why they did it. His parents were involved with a the [[Doctrine of St. Galling]], and openly opposed it using their influence. The doctrine hired assassins to publicly execute them and make it clear it was religiously motivated (as a warning), without tying it directly to the church. They failed, and then burned the house down. They're still wanted to this day. Gemini gets a chance to confront them. They're still in their prime, but they're definitely older than him. 

### The Duel of the Drug Runners
Investigating the cartel from Bjorn's past / what their motivations were. They were drug runners for [[Overclock]], but had an agreement with the [[Armstrong Initiative]] to hand off some of their prisoners in exchange for chemicals and no legal intervention. 
This leads Bjorn back to earth, where he encounters his parents, and subsequently tries to prove his worth to them. 

### The Lost Amulet of Blugler
Investigating what destroyed Taure's village, and why it / they took the heirloom. The heirloom was [[Exotic Metals|Nethrium]] something nearby pirates saw as a means of establishing a positive relationship with [[House Galling]]. The village refused to turn it over, so he invaded the village and took it by force. 
While on their way, they stop at Mt. Stinkus to stay with Taure's parents. They might even get involved in the conflict and help their little boy steal his money. They're really sweet sounding, but have some truly disturbing world views that passed down to Taure. 

### The Pride of the Kenku
Investigating what caused Corvus' amnesia, and why? His people were involved in a rebellion against the [[Doctrine of St. Galling|Church of Saint Galling]]. They declared independence, and were massacred by [[Inquisitors]]. Corvus was very young at the time, and barely remembers it. There are more Kenku out there, but they're rare, and scattered. 

### Leonin Genesis Evangel Lion 
Investigating what created Copper, and why? He was involved with a subsect of the [[Armstrong Initiative]], and he managed to escape with an [[incarnadine gate]]. The scars are from experimentation.

# Plot Concepts
### General:
- Uncharted / Gravity Falls style treasure hunt. Involve ciphers, puzzles, and riddles with some form of mysterious plot.
- Splitting up for personalized challenges.
- Becoming blind, deaf, mute, or paralyzed and having to work around it. 
- A social deduction challenge (imposter, interrogation, murder mystery)
- Plotting, and executing a heist for some item or person to rescue. 
- A time bomb / real time challenge
- High stakes gambling for something [[the party]] needs.
- Wish magic based on player sketches.
- FFA Hunger Games esc. scenario. 
- A localized anomaly is causing a time loop. They get caught in it, and need to undo it to escape. 
- Body swapping PCs. 
- A distress call is requesting immediate assistance on a derelict space station. 
- A legendary monster has something / is causing some issue, and needs to be hunted. 
- Some valuable cargo needs to be transported through some volatile location / route. 
- Surviving a crazy game show from a malevolent and powerful Mr. Beast inspired lunatic. 
- They've angered the wrong people, and now their ship is under attack. They need to use the ship's systems to defend themselves, and keep them from entering the cockpit. 
### Lore Specific:
- [[Bradford]] has a "guard dog" character. A fiercely loyal warforged that genuinely wants to be around [[Bradford]]. It's the only "person" [[Bradford]] has a real connection with. He's a big, clumsy, intimidating robot (or an illithid with his own faction, or maybe a beholder) who wants nothing more but to follow the orders of [[Bradford]]. This character is heavily involved in overseeing the [[Armstrong Initiative]].
- Rebellions against the [[Federation]] and or [[House Galling]] / [[Bradford]] have formed and are attempting something that requires help from [[the party]]. 
- There's a bizarro version of [[the party]] that acts as a foil. They grow in power at the same rate, are just as capable, and reflect altered versions of the each party member's traits.
