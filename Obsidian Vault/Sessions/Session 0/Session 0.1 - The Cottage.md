The approach:
- [[Pluto's Cottage]] is in [[The Deadwoods]], a dank, nearly uninhabitable forest moon. The terrain is unnavigable, with steep muddy cliffs, mile wide trees that block your vision, and rivers big enough to swallow a house. The weather is unbearable, with a constant onslaught of heavy floods, thunderstorms, and thick fog. Typically, not the kind of place you'd want to visit. 
- It's a dark, cold, stormy night. You land the ship at the nearest clearing, and begin the hike to the property. You wander through slippery soaked terrain for what feels like hours, barely seeing through the heavy rain and thick fog. Every once and awhile, hearing whispers and cracking branches behind you. You feel paranoid, anxious, and lost. But Just then, you catch a glimpse of the cottage through the dense fog.

Exterior:
- And... it looks abandoned. The boards are splintering, the roof is dripping, and the stench of rot stings your nostrils. The house lets out an eerie groan as it's supports decay beneath under its own weight. Judging by the level of natural damage, you'd guess it's no less than a 100 years old. There's no one for miles. Why would they send you all the way out here? 
- On the outside of the house lies a large steel door angled down. It has a small glass window bolted into it, but you can't make out any details on the other side. The door has a strange hole in it. It's supposedly a keyhole, but not like anything you recognize. There's no handle. 

Living room:
- 2 plush soaked blue sofas sit perpendicular to the moldy stone fireplace. A coffee table lies on it's side, with scorch marks, bullet holes, and bite marks from some animal. The walls are leering left and coming apart, with the light fixtures loosely holding on and tinted with dried blood. The muted blue and green carpet reeks of blood and urine. There are thick dirty drag marks across the floor leading into the library.
- Around the corner is the dining room, through the left door is the kitchen, there's a set of stairs to your right, and a door to the library in front of you. 
- There's a large mirror, and if you look closely you can see the imprint of face smeared into it.

Dining room:
- The dining room is a shattered remnant of past luxury. A massive, once-grand table lies in disarray, hollowed by bullet holes, scorch marks, and deep gashes as though hacked with an axe. The chairs are in splinters, and glass from the windows lies strewn across the floor. The wallpaper peels in damp strips, revealing faded, intricate designs beneath. The remains of what looks like melted wax candles drip down the candelabra at the table’s center, casting an almost ghostly sheen in the sparse light.

Kitchen:
- The kitchen feels cramped and oppressive, with cracked white tiles crawling up the walls, each fissure and discoloration a reminder of its age. Rust streaks every metal surface, and a thick, pungent smell wafts from the broken cupboards. Any glass is either shattered or streaked with grime, and the old, once-sturdy countertops are swollen and warped from decades of moisture. Flies buzz around, and faint scuttling noises echo from the shadows.
- Inside one of the study cabinets, you can find one of the only documents that's been preserved; [[Pluto]]'s cookbook. These are all [[Pluto]]'s recipes, and it's not the fanciest homemade cookbook out there. You flip through it, and the entries start out simple enough. There are recipes for cakes, plutonian corn weevils, and elysian snake steaks, but the last entry is very different. %90 of the page is empty, but in the center is a sketch of a man in a box.  

Library:
- The books are soaked and ruined after centuries of relentless storming, and on top of the central table, a lies skeleton with a sword through it's chest and through the table. It's clothes are ripped and decayed, but his uniform is very nearly identical to your own.  
- The sword is rusted beyond use, but you do notice that the sword's hilt is embossed with the logo of [[House Galling]]. 
- The outfit belonged to someone named Rayan. 

Bedroom:
- It's much more intact than the rest of the building. The drenched rag-covered bed has long since collapsed, and the creaky floors are covered in dirt. However, something catches your eye. In the middle of a bed lies a steel box.
- Inside the box is a scroll. The scroll appears to be a map of the home, with two marks on it. One is in the storage room, and the other is outside. 

Bathroom:
- The bathroom reeks of decay, with mold creeping up the walls and brown water stains on every surface. The shattered tiles beneath their feet are slick with black grime. Water drips steadily from a corroded faucet into the cracked basin, each drop echoing ominously in the still air. The bathtub is full of murky, still water, thick with an oily substance that shimmers slightly under any light. A cracked window lets in a sliver of moonlight, illuminating scattered broken glass and rodent nests in the corners. There's also a large totally blacked out painting hung on the wall.
 - Perceptive players (16+) will notice a hole in the painting, and the distinct smell of rust coming from it. Pulling back the painting reveals a massive safe. Back in the day, this thing would have been impenetrable, but it's old and rusted. 
	- If you manage to open it, you find a limp, half-decayed white tentacle that's warm to the touch. Aside it is a [[House Galling]] security badge belonging to someone named [[Pluto]], dated 200 years prior. 

Storage room:
- The storage room is dimly lit by the eerie glow of the full moon filtering through a caved-in ceiling. Weathered wooden crates and rusted metal chests are strewn haphazardly across the damp floor, their surfaces covered in layers of grime and dust.
- Inside the crates you can find an assortment of things depending on what you roll.
	- 1: As you open the crate, a burst of mycelial spores enter your nose, eyes, mouth, and lungs. You're poisoned, and reduced to half hp. 
	- 2 - 5: Nothing of note. Just some weathered papers and worms. 
	- 6-10: Canned lithworms and other preserved meats and rations that are still good. 
	- 11-15: A small pouch with 25 gp in it
	- 16-19: A framed photo of [[Pluto]] with a large group of pirates.
	- 20: You open the crate and see that 95% of it's space is just padding for what's in the middle. Remove the padding lets you find a small glass vial, with a fragment of inky purple steel inside.
- If you're perceptive, you may notice an unusually shaped brass key. What it goes to you don't know.

Office:
- The office is dark and claustrophobic, with rotting wooden shelves lined with decrepit books and scrolls that are mostly illegible. Dust motes float in the faint moonlight filtering through a cracked window. A large, dark wood desk dominates the center, its polished surface covered in mold, water damage, and something like ash. A large, gold-framed painting of a severe-looking man—labelled “[[Pluto]], the Wanted”—hangs on the wall, his eyes seeming to track every movement. A worn globe rests on a nearby shelf.
	- The desk contains old timey letter writing stuff. You can tell this guy was in to doing this the old fashioned way. 

Basement:
- The key fits, and with a loud clunk, the handle emerges. 
- You grab the handle, and lift the heavy door. It slams down onto the ground, and reveals a set of metal steps. You can't see where they go. 
- You walk down a flight of rusty stairs and into the pitch black. 
- At the bottom of the stairs is a small muddy room, with a gold trimmed chest in the middle. There are handprints and claw marks in the walls. Was this dug by hand?
- Inside the chest is a letter,
	- To Whomever Finds This,
		It has been four long decades since that fateful night—the night my crew and I plundered the secrets of [[House Galling]]. In my possession lies a treasure beyond comprehension: 404 billion credits worth of [[Nethrium]]. But this wealth has become a curse, a shackle binding me to shadows and whispers.
		
		This wasn’t what I thought. Something went wrong, and I now find myself burdened with a terrible responsibility. The weight of my guilt grows heavier each day, and the specters of my past are closing in. I barely escaped the clutches of one of their men, but I am no longer fit to carry this burden. The decades of running have worn me thin, and the pressure is suffocating.
		
		I am writing this as a final plea. You must take my place. But heed my warning—if you wish to claim what is mine, you must prove yourself worthy through trials fraught with peril. Only through courage and sacrifice will the truth be made clear. If you dare to proceed, follow these coordinates: 9110713, 0642090, 5318008.
		
		But know this: trust no one. No one. The shadows have eyes, and though alone, I feel like I’m being watched. Don’t tell them! Don’t tell anyone! No matter what they offer! They cannot know! They aren’t what they seem! The creature
		
		From, [[Pluto]]
