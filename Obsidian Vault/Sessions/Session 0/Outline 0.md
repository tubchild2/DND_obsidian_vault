Step 7: Opening monologue for session 0
- It’s quiet. In the dim, flickering glow of the ship's lights, we see **_(list everyone’s names)_** sitting in the cramped, worn-out front portion of an rusty spaceship. The ship’s interior is riddled with stains, grime, and lingering smells of mildew, with rusty pipes snaking along the walls. In several places, the bold, unforgiving logo of [[House Galling]] is stamped into the metal, a silent reminder of who owns this vessel—and everything in it.

- You were all hired recently as ‘general-purpose assistants’ for [[House Galling]]—not exactly the dream job, but you needed the money, and as it happened, ***(#players)*** job openings had just become available all at once. Unfortunately, you’re making less than minimum wage, since the Gallings take out ‘equipment usage fees’ from every check. They issued you some basic gear: red and black over-suits, gas masks, heavy-duty boots, and one old, flickering flashlight each. 

- You’ve known each other for about a month. While you aren’t exactly close, the job has given you a rough idea of each other’s quirks and habits. Earlier today, you were assigned to investigate one of [[House Galling]]’s old properties for what they described only as “disturbances.” They didn’t explain further, though one of you overheard a supervisor mentioning something about “liabilities” in a hushed tone, glancing over their shoulder as they did.

- So here you are. The mission is simple on paper, but as you look around at the faces of your fellow crew members, you can’t help but wonder... What are you all walking into? What do you guys think?
