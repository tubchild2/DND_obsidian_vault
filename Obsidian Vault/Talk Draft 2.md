**INTRODUCTION**
What is prophecy? What would you do if someone asked you that question? Prophecy is no doubt one of the single most important elements of our beliefs: it's incredibly faith strengthening, it teaches us a lot about Jehovah, and it gives us incredibly important information for our day to day lives, especially now in the last days. However, it can also feel very cryptic, and without deep knowledge of early middle eastern history, it can be hard to fully wrap your head around. So, what is prophecy exactly, and how did it work in the Bible? We're going to briefly look at a few verses to see what the Bible has to say about it, because if there's anyone to look to for information about God's words, it's God's word.

**WHAT IS PROPHECY**
So, what is prophecy? If you could open your Bibles please to 2 Peter 1:20, 21, we can see the Bible's answer. 2 Peter 1:20, 21. It says, 
"For you know this first, that *no* prophecy of Scripture springs from any *private interpretation*. For prophecy was at *no time* brought by *man's will*, but men spoke *from god* as they were moved by holy spirit."
Did you notice that it said that the men spoke from god? So if it wasn't man willing prophecy into existence, then the simplest definition would be that prophecy is a message inspired by God; or a divine revelation. A prophet, then, is anyone who receives this message from God and shares it with others.

But what about foretelling the future, then? Well according to the Bible's definition, prophecy doesn't *have* to involve foretelling the future. There are actually many instances in the Bible in which prophets receive information from Jehovah but don't foretell the future. A great example of this is found in Judges 6:6-10. Turn with me if you'd like. If you recall, at this time the Israelites were distressed because of the actions of the Midianites, so they were calling to Jehovah for help. Judges 6:6-10. It says, 
"So Israel became greatly impoverished on account of Midʹi·an; and the Israelites called to Jehovah for help. When the Israelites called to Jehovah for help because of Midʹi·an, Jehovah sent to the Israelites a prophet who said to them: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, ‘I brought you up from Egypt and thus brought you out of the house of slavery. So I rescued you from the hand of Egypt and from all your oppressors and drove them out from before you and gave you their land. And I said to you: “I am Jehovah your God. You must not fear the gods of the Amʹor·ites in whose land you are dwelling.” But you did not obey me.’”"
So, what's happening? In response to the Israelite's call for help, Jehovah sent one of his prophets to explain that they wouldn't receive Jehovah's help because they were practicing false worship. The prophet wasn't alluding to the future at all, and yet the verse still calls the man a prophet. Why? Well, because he was still communicating a message from Jehovah. Meaning prophecy doesn't necessarily have to involve the future.

**HOW DID PROPHECY OCCUR**
So we know prophecy is Jehovah communicating with humans, but how did it happen? The Bible mentions several ways God communicated. 

We're going through Isaiah, so I thought a good place to start were with visions. Jehovah gave several prophets like Isaiah, Ezekiel, and John. According to Acts 10:10, some of these visions placed the prophet in a trance, and others were vivid enough that they participated in them, like in Luke 9:28-36. We just read about an example of these vivid visions a few weeks ago in Isaiah 6, when Isaiah had a vision of the Seraphs, and he heard the voice of Jehovah and said, "Here I am, send me!"

Jehovah also supplied written works on at least one occasion with the 10 commandments. 

Additionally, many prophets were mentally guided by God to convey his messages. We briefly touched on this already with the Bible writers. As we read earlier in 2 Timothy 3:16, "all scripture is inspired of God." That phrase, "inspired of God" can also be translated as, "God-breathed." So, God used his holy spirit to "breathe" his ideas into the minds of his servants. He guided their thoughts, allowing the prophets to use their own wording, but to transmit God's messages.

Lastly, on some occasions, Jehovah sent angels to directly communicate with the prophets. There's several well-known instances of this, like if we think back Luke 1: 28-30, when Mary was visited by the Angel Gabriel to inform her about Jesus' birth. Jehovah sent angels to communicate long before that too. If you could turn with me to Exodus 3:2-4. Exodus 3:2-4. 
It says, "Then *Jehovah's angel* appeared to him in a flame of fire in the midst of a thornbush. As he kept looking, he saw that the thornbush was not consumed. So Moses said, "I will go over to inspect this unusual sight to see why the thornbush does not burn up." When Jehovah saw that he went over to look, God called him *out of the thornbush* as said, "Moses! Moses!" To which he said, "Here I am.""
