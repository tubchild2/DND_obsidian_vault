### The Tone
- Adventurous. Doesn't involve the fate of the world right away.
- Fantastical. Industrial Era Arctic Clone Wars.
- Sincere. Doesn't poke fun at itself.
- Epic. Themes of power, conquest, revenge, justice, etc.
- Emotional. Doesn't shy from making people feel things.

### Session 1
Zoom into central Arcohaem. We pan over the mountains and down into a capital city comprised of Canadian gothic/brutalist architecture bordering a frigid forest lake. The capital's name is [[Hephaestus]]. The people dress in Inuit-inspired clothes, and they have adopted an efficient, industrialized way of life built around trolleys and railways. 


Session 0: 
- You are immune to cold damage, but vulnerable to fire damage. Additionally, wearing too much causes you to overheat. While wearing medium or heavy armor, you have 1 level of exhaustion.
