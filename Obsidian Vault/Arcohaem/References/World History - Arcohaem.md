### History
12c 400
- The 9 tribes of [[Arcohaem]] are founded
- There are also 6 other Tribes that live in the deep south or far west that are independent from the republic.
	- Qorra. SOUTH
	- Kallik, SOUTH
	- Sesi. SOUTH
	- Kari. EAST
	- Solvi. EAST
	- Skalth. EAST
- There's also Lemnaeus, which is an independent town that's not technically in [[Arcohaem]], but it's a very important port to the region. It's at the easternmost point. 

12c 604
- The Republic of [[Arcohaem]] was founded from the 9 tribes of [[Arcohaem]].

12c 1255
- Kry Brisk becomes the King of [[Frigoshia]].
- Caldus Kaul becomes the Chancellor of the Republic.
- Kaul is pushed to usher in rapid technological changes by Malfaust. It'd help their people to live better, healthier, wealthier lives. It would mean power, safety, and security for the Republic. If Kaul helped Malfaust in faking a conflict, and amassed wealth, weapons, and knowledge for him, Malfaust would spare him and his family's life. Kaul didn't agree with Malfaust on everything, but he truly does serve what he believes are the best interests of his people. He agreed.
- Brisk is pushed to declare independence by Malfaust. It'd help to maintain their people's cultural identity. If Brisk agreed to fake the conflict, and agreed to start a dragon breeding program, Malfaust would ensure the safety of the Frigoshians and continued independence. Brisk would need to find and grow Dragon eggs for his chromatic brethren to ensure enough damage could be done to conquer all of Serendipita. Brisk is freaking nuts and is fully on board with supporting Malfaust if it means preserving his people's culture.

12c 1256 THE START OF THE ARCOHAEMIAN CIVIL WAR
- The Republic--especially the capital, Hephaestus--experience rapid changes amidst the industrial revolution. Transportation, government, weaponry, culture, and trade all undergo a complete metamorphosis. Chancellor Kaul convinced people that the changes, though major, would allow them access to food, and supplies, and an easier way of life free from the primitive life they're currently living. Railroads were built between all members of the republic but [[Frigoshia]].
- The [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] people rejected the rapid changes; they want to keep their culture and way of life in tact. They see the industrial revolution and E-Tech as a worldly cancer. The [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] senator was assassinated by the Republic for treason, prompting a civil war.
- [[Frigoshia]] controlled more territory than the other tribes, and their people were already skilled warriors before the war. Their war-crime ridden campaign butchered northwestern [[Arcohaem]]. They slaughtered innocent people, bombed towns, and operated with sickening indifference.

12c 1259
- The Republic's new Eathyst powered weapons matched [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] skill, leading to a brutal territorial tug-of-war. Neither could get the upper hand. That's what the public thinks. The truth is... Malfaust is having both Kaul and Brisk prevent the war from continuing so that the Republic can build weapons and soldiers, and the Frigoshians can breed Dragons.

12c 1265
- The war has raged on, with neither side making any major progress.
- Relying on thinning Yak products and root vegetables, the [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] people are beginning to starve. Food is being diverted away from the lower-class and towards the military.
- A [[Frigoshia|Frigoshian]] diplomat was sent to visit the republic to extend an olive branch, but was publicly stabbed to death by *elite* Republic guards under the direct command of Chancellor Kaul.

12c 1266
- Arcohaemian spies uncovered King Brisk's draconic plot and alerted the entire Senate, which puts Kaul in a tricky situation. Kaul needs the mission to fail to protect the interests of his master, but he can't ignore it without arousing suspicion. 
- He chose the [[PCs - Arcohaem|Wolves of Arcohaem]] to carry out the task due to their inconsistent track record. They're told that the Republic cannot directly invade [[Frigoshia]], and they cannot divert troops away from the capital in case the Frigoshians have "enough Dragons to invade already." The [[PCs - Arcohaem|Wolves of Arcohaem]] need to stop the program before it's too late or the Republic will fall and destabilize the entire economy of Serendipita. 
- Their mission is simple: infiltrate Frigoshia and destroy the dragon breeding program.
