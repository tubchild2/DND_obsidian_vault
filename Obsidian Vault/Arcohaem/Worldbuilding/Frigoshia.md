Military:
- Soldiers are trained from the ages of 8-18. Each warrior learns from a master and trains an apprentice. At 18 they undergo a 10 day trek across the wilderness to prove that they're self-sufficient men, and ready to earn the title of master. This important Frigoshian rite is known as "the binding," as it binds a man to nature, and makes him ready to tackle anything that comes his way.
