Goal: create a TTRPG that becomes a simulacrum. 

Process:
- Stage 1: The Simulation. Players are playing a TTRPG about players playing a TTRPG about players playing a TTRPG and so on. It's a copy of reality.
- Stage 2: The Simulacrum. Decisions made affect all lower layers. The line between reality and game is blurred. 
- Stage 3: The Hyperreality. Decisions made in the real world affect the game, so what is the game and what isn't?

This process would need to be a gradual revelation to be pulled off.

Part 1: Players play themselves playing a TTRPG. It's a basic simulation

Part 2: The players one layer down are playing a TTRPG about themselves playing a TTRPG, which is about the players playing a TTRPG and so on. It's an infinite loop of players all the way down.

Part 3: All changes to the environment affect all lower levels. For example, if, on layer 1, you move a box, all layers of greater value also have the box move on its own.

Part 4: the Battlemap lets you alter the environment on all lower levels directly. 

Part 5: doing things in the real world affect all layers.

Part 6: something happens one layer above reality, and something happens in the real world.

Part 7: the line between what is reality and what is the game is gone. The game is now more real than fiction, and it has nothing it's basing itself off of.
