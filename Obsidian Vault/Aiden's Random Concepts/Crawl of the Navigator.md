### LORE
Time
- It's 1990. An alien invasion happened 3 months ago. Everyone has independently found each other.

Lore
- The plot revolves around the Mother, an alien lifeform. Its true scale is unknown, and its functionality even more so. It resembles a coffin sized seed with a vivid deep red leathery texture. After it seeds, it grows rapidly and exponentially to unfathomable sizes. It then builds more seeds and deploys them to other planets as meteor showers. At each planet it visits, it selects organisms that were helpful to its seeding and clones them in the pods. It carries hundreds of thousands of plants and animals with it whenever it seeds. It appears to be only semi-organic, as it constructs several large machines of unknowable purpose.
- January 14th 1989. The pods silently descend from the sky and seed themselves. Emerging from them are several aggressive and territorial front-line creatures that defend the pods by eliminating all nearby life. The invasion is sudden, and incredibly aggressive. The surprise attack cripples global infrastructure, leaving the citizens to fend for themselves. The pods grow so rapidly that they resemble skyscrapers in days. They begin to link together by the end of the first week, and then they begin their work.
- The sky is blotted out. The entire planet is a network of semi-organic caverns and tunnels. They've incorporated themselves into human architecture, leaving strange amalgams here and there. The mother keeps growing and building, some things are mechanical, some are organic, some seem to serve no purpose. It's beyond us.
- The new ecosystem is rapidly adapting to the planet. Here are the local creatures:
	- Demogorgon / Death Angel: Serves as front line soldier for the mother. They have a common and exploitable weakness, but they're incredibly fast, strong, and durable. A run and hide type of monster.
	- Demodog: serves as the grunt for the mother. Small dog like creatures that are stronger than a human, but not very durable. Powerful in numbers.
	- Cordecyps / X-Parasite / Bane: brings the body near death, causes rapid growth of bones, skin, and tumors, and then brings them into a state of terminal lucidity. They have mere hours to live, so the new body tries desperately to gather nutrients by making them incredibly hungry and aggressive. When the body gives out, they grow pillars out of them that vent spores to nearby creatures.
	- Bell Ringer: convinces people to merge with it to become immortal. Shows their life to be meaningless, short, and deeply flawed. The Mother's 5-star general. 
	- Elephant Piranha: long eel-like fish that lives in water. Inflicts 60 second paralysis with its bite. 
	- Octopus Spider: a land creature with 8 long, thin, sharp legs. They can bend and twist like tendrils, but to walk on them, it typically keeps them rigid. Its legs connect to a spherical body with a thick, stinger imbued tail. Its incredibly quiet, and hard to spot in the dark. Its tail can do a lot of damage and inflict 60 second paralysis. 

Visuals
- The aliens impregnated the planet with a whole unknowable ecosystem that has covered the planet, turning it into something completely unrecognizable. Everything is built up of intense vivid colors, unknowably massive organisms, and machines they can't quantify that seem semi-organic. Things you can't understand and won't. 

Music
- The music features long, deep, drown out chords. 
- Melodies are made up of high bells. They feel off and incomplete. 
- Music from another world.
Soundtrack
- Maridia (Swampy Caverns)
- A Realm Unspoiled By Mankind
- Metroid Fusion OST
- Waterwheel by C418

Ambience
- Organic but alien
- Analog clunkiness
- Radio focus

### SESSION
While exploring, they become trapped. One player has a key piece of immovable information that they need to communicate to a mobile player. For example, one player has a map and a radio, and the other player needs to listen to their instructions. The spice comes from the hazards, task management, stress, and things that're difficult to explain.

Their goal is to reactivate an radio tower atop an infected laboratory to try and make contact with others. They don't see any creatures right away, but the place is a maze. All players have walkie talkies.

One player has a map and navigates everyone, but the map is cryptic and doesn't display where they are. Additionally, there are monsters roaming the halls that need to be dealt with. 

Tasks:
- Get the auxiliary power back on
	- Navigate through floor one
	- Go to the basement
		- Infected, cavernous, unknowable
		- Flooded
		- Elephant Piranha in the water
	- Activate auxiliary power
		- In a room with a Demodog like creature
		- Requires focus and referencing a manual
			- Similar to keep talking and nobody explodes
- Use the radio
	- Get out of the basement
	- Navigate through floor one
		- Demodog like creatures in the halls that need to be baited or avoided
		- The map is wrong, as several large organic walls have sprouted and are blocking hallways.
	- Navigate through floor two
		- A door switch is broken, meaning someone needs to keep it held down. It's incredibly tough to do, meaning it can't be simply propped down. On the other side of the floor is another switch, meaning someone needs to temporarily stay behind.
		- While staying behind, a demodog like creature enters the room, forcing them to hide, trapping the people on the other side with another demodog like creature.
		- If the one that stayed behind manages to avoid the demodog and keep the switch down, letting the others out, then the others can activate the non-broken switch and let the one that stayed behind catch up.
	- Go to the roof
		- The radio messages are creepy, eldritch, garbled voices.
		- It becomes astonishingly clear that there's no one coming to help them.
