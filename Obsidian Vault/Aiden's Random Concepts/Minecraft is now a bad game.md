- Villagers skip majority of progression
- For players that know what they're doing, villagers are always the best option
- Villages themselves are too powerful for inexperienced players
- They aren't fun
- They remove challenge

Feel
- The game isn't lonely or mysterious anymore
	- There are structures everywhere
	- It's AAA and corporatized
- The game doesn't drive you to create, it drives you to try the new content
	- The new updates don't add tools, they add toys.
- Minecraft is too efficient and overwhelming
	- Get A to get B to get C to do D
		- Villagers
		- Redstone farms
		- Massive builds
	- instead of
	- Be in the moment and build what you want to build however you want to make it
- Lena Raine just ain't C418, she's good, but she's not the GOAT
	- Hire him back for the love of god
	- Just give him the rights to his music

# Minecraft can be Fixed
Greatly simplify UI
Make UI emptier
For future updates, focus on adding systems that can interact rather than content that can be exhausted
Make resources easier to acquire so that redstone isn't necessary
Make structures much rarer, worlds emptier, and more space for creativity
Make structures yield much more to reward exploration
Make terrain generation much wider
Nerf the hell out of villagers, tie them to your progression, and make their housing system more demanding to encourage the construction of actual cities instead of prisons.
Hire C418 and give him the rights to his music
