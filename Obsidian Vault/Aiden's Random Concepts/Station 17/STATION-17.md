# OVERVIEW
-- STORY --
After the moon landing, the US began constructing laboratories on the moon to run secrets away from soviet intervention. You're a new recruit, and it's your job to maintain STATION-17: a deep space radio tower. You'll be retrieved in 6 months; until then, you cannot exit the station. Monitor incoming signals and maintain the station.

-- TONE --
A lonely, quiet, and atmospheric horror game. It's a slow burn, with each night becoming progressively intense and unsettling. Majority of time is spent in silence, apart from the hum of radio equipment. The player's free time is spent attempting to immerse the player, and evoke a feeling of wonder at their situation.

-- STYLE --
1980s clunky sci-fi ruins. Big panels with big buttons and switches and blinking lights. Junky but fixable. 
The music is 1980s slow atmospheric tense synth. Stranger Things + C418 Arpeggios.

# STORY
-- Chapter 1 --
After the moon landing, the US began constructing laboratories on the moon to run secrets away from soviet intervention. You're a new recruit, and it's your job to maintain STATION-17: a deep space radio tower. You'll be retrieved in 6 months; until then, you cannot exit the station. Monitor incoming signals and maintain the station.

You arrive in the cramped station and are left completely isolated. Your daily grind begins. During the day, manage your responsibilities. During the night, monitor signals and keep track of the cameras. This continues for a few days. The isolation, repetition, and atmosphere is drilled into you.

-- Chapter 2 --
Something strange begins happening. The "meteor" activity you're monitoring becomes much more dangerous, as you now need to dispel it with PRE devices, and repair damaged seals. You also now have access to a lockdown terminal that'll let you seal doors. This doesn't seem like something that would need to be installed here.

-- Chapter 3 --
The "meteors" difficult to see, but they don't look or act like meteors. You can't see them during the day for some reason, and during the night, they move away from the PRE devices. Which, as you found by browsing the files, are just lights. They have no special functionality of any kind. Additionally, the instructions say that there should be a radar somewhere, but it's no where to be seen. It *should* monitor meteor storms.

-- Chapter 4 --
Puzzles get weirder and harder as you progress. You'd need advanced knowledge of mathematics, physics, geography, literature, and programming to solve them all. One person isn't meant to find and solve them all.

Events and secrets get weirder the harder you look
- Auditory hallucinations of voices, thunder, trumpets, rain, shaking, humming, dogs, babies, screaming, and groaning.
- Visual hallucinations of lightning, men in suits, darkness, movement, creatures of indeterminate size and shape, and objects with no textures.
- There are several really adult themes hidden within what is supposed to be a child's game.
- Censored areas, "banned" areas
- Some rooms appear out of nowhere between other rooms and cannot be found again.
- Music occasionally cuts itself off mid loop for seemingly no reason.
- Your saves can be corrupted and jump to moments you've never seen or played.
- Some events happen exclusively on repeat playthroughs
- Some events happen through sheer luck.
- Some events happen when you leave the game alone for a long time.
- A Local Access Alert system on the moon for some reason.
- The TV can display
	- Men in suits
	- Old cartoons
	- Old, monochromatic, real life photographs with black boxes over people's eyes.
	- Static text
	- An uncanny face
	- Alarms
- Equipment doesn't work for a few tries, or has its functionality inverted
- Radio moments like Morse code, distorted voices, distorted music, warnings, etc.
- Tonal dissonance
- Visual dissonance
- References to things that don't make sense in the game, the world, or in general.

-- Chapter 5 --
On day 20, the transponder begins going off in the control room. The government is coming to relieve you of your position.

Bad Ending:
	If you leave the transponder on, government officials take you on day 16. You are relieved of your position and expelled into space.

Good Ending
	If you turn the transponder off, government officials fail to locate you in time. On day 16, you get to endure one more night of anomalies. Whatever they are, they really want in. Then, an anomaly much bigger and more powerful than anything else enters the building. It disables your equipment and enters you room in the dark.
	You begin having intense and vivid hallucinations of massive trees, angelic imagery, classified documents, screaming, and incomprehensible symbols. Then, you wake up in the middle of a field, supposedly back home.
