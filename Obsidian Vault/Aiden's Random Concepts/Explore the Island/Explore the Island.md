You spawn on the coast of a procedurally generating island, and you're tasked with exploring it to locate a radio tower. I'm aiming for a vibe like classic Minecraft: curiosity driven, atmospheric, and a tiny bit unsettling just because you're alone. Textures are 64x64. Sounds are synthesized and bit crushed.

The name of the game here is exploration. It's not so much about where you're going, and more about what cool stuff you can find along the way. Riddle the game with Easter eggs.

Listof Potential Easter Eggs
- Out of the box puzzles: 
	- You need advanced knowledge of mathematics, physics, geography, literature, and programming.
	- Altering the game's settings.
	- You need to replay a section multiple times.
	- You need to get out of bounds.
	- You need to exploit intentional glitches.
	- Manipulating the game window.
	- You need to abuse a really obscure mechanic.
	- Real world actions like getting a second player, using your camera, or using your microphone.
	- You need to access the game's files to alter obscure settings.
	- You need to give the game access to important files.
	- You need to turn the game off in a specific location.
- Random events (so absurd and insane that if someone told you about it, you wouldn't believe them)
	- Censored or "Banned" events that don't play out
	- Unfinished areas (some of the missing or unfinished rooms you visit finish themselves while unobserved)
	- Music occasionally cuts itself off mid loop for seemingly no reason.
	- Some spaces appear out of nowhere between other spaces and cannot be accessed again.
	- Major bugs and exploits teleport the player to an "error room." These make it seem intentional even when the bugs likely weren't.
	- Some events happen exclusively on repeat playthroughs or through sheer luck.
	- Some events happen when you leave the game alone for a long time.
	- The game fakes you out with a Local Access Alert system.
	- The game displays real life photographs with black boxes over people's eyes.
	- Radio moments like morse, distorted voices, distorted music, warnings, etc.
