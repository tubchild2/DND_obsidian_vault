### **POWERS**
**LIMINAL PLANE**
	All conscious creatures exist in parallel, once in reality, and once in the liminal plane. 
	The liminal plane is an infinitely large space devoid of light and matter. 
	Every conscious creature's non-physical being manifests as a small incandescent node within the liminal plane.
	Self-awareness, emotions, and intelligence increase the node's size.
	These nodes can be manipulated by entities accessing the liminal plane.

**ASCENDED AWARENESS**
	The liminal plane can only be accessed by creatures with ascended awareness.
	Originally, this meant exclusively higher beings.
	However, some physical creates exist that are capable of sensing and interacting with the liminal plane.

**NETWORKING**
	Nodes can be connected by those with ascended awareness, forming a hive mind.
	Within a hive mind, all conscious minds merge and act as one over all physical bodies.
	Nodes of greater size or awareness have a greater impact over the hive.
	Self-awareness, emotions, and intelligence increase the node's size.
	The hive remains intact as long as the entity that created it is alive, or until they dissolve it.
	When hives dissolve, all original memories and functions return to each node, with the addition of blurry, incomplete memories of the hive.
	Hives completely alter the creator while active due to merging radically different minds together into one. 
	One mind of similar or greater intelligence can be enough to completely change a user's personality and motives into some middle ground between the two's shared memories.

**ASSERTION**
	Those with ascended awareness can attempt to enforce their will onto another's body.
	To do this, they need to form a temporary hive between themselves and the target.
	Then, they need greater willpower than the target, typically requiring practice and absolute focus.
	If the target is aware of what they're doing, the target can mentally resist, making stealth key to success.
	Once they're will is asserted, they can do a handful of things:
		- Extraction of information
		- Forcing the target to perform an action
		- Causing physical, auditory, or visual hallucinations
		- Inflicting pain

**PROGRESSION**
	Use of ascended awareness on targets not linked via a hive depletes the body's resources.
	Like a muscle, force of will via ascended awareness grows with use.
	As the muscle gets stronger, and the user becomes more skilled, they can
		- Assert their will easier
		- Target more people
		- Extract information faster
		- Force actions the target doesn't want to do
		- Create more convincing hallucinations to the point they feel real
	Additionally, users with hives are multiple times more powerful due to processing with more minds.
	The body is only meant to grow so powerful, so hive progenitors will begin to deform with time. The differentiation between individual flesh blurs, and they grow to resemble higher beings.

### **LORE**
Graham Taulman lived in Mountain View, Arkansas. After acquiring ascended awareness, he began to explore the minds around him. He gained perspective unlike anyone else ever had, and found an overwhelming obsession with time and death. It was the leading motivation for everything everyone did.

Everyone had such little time but they wasted it, and were too afraid to do what they wanted to. Then, about halfway through their life, they get perspective on their life, and they realize what they want to do. But, by then they're too old. Then, time speeds up faster and faster until they begin to fade away and fall apart. Once people are actually faced with death, they reject it, they fight it, they try to get around it, they become hopeless, and then they just accept it how it is and give up. They spent all their life working in expectation of something they never had a chance of really acquiring. Then they die, and everything they ever did, and everyone they ever knew, and everything they ever interacted with, would be slowly forgotten, and would drift away into a mass of human machines slowly churning the same system out over and over again. 

How depressing it was that no one else would ever see it. If only they knew, they'd understand that nothing they thought mattered really did. If he could show them, then they'd see. So, he lured his friend into a private area and formed a hive between the two...

and it was good.

They didn't resist. Together they were stronger, and saw the beauty more truly than ever. 

Slowly, one by one, Graham began to expand his hive. As the progenitor of the hive, his life meant the hive's life. He began to dwell underground. His form began to melt and grow as the hive expanded. But that was only half of Graham's goal; he sought to solve death. Then, they learned that with his new form, flesh could merge with flesh to form a larger organism. So, the hive began to coalesce...

and it was good.

The hive's new form was more akin to a tree than a man. He lived underground, with roots stretching deep below the surface. It was constantly rotting, so to preserve the lives of those merged, it needs to regularly find and lure people to the caves to add their mind and flesh to the hive. Thus began the never-ending cycle of hunger and rot. In his eyes, he's freeing people. However, he's stripping away their individuality, free will, and bodies in favor of becoming part of his immortal form. He's killing them, and absorbing their intelligences. Though they go willingly, they don't have a choice, as they can't realistically resist the hive's influence. They are subjected to the terrors of time and death, then shown the beauty of the hive. But Graham could do more. So much more. And he wants to. Additionally, the bell ringer will occasionally just kill people it disagrees with for more flesh.

In 1966, there were a string of 17 disappearances, mostly of children. Then, once a year, every year, someone in the town of Mountain View Arkansas hears the tolling of a church bell in the distance. Then, they begin having hallucinations. These get more and more intense, showing them how their lives are insignificant and how time and death are unavoidable. They get headaches, nightmares, muscle spasms, dilated pupils, and a constant looming feeling of dread. Then, a week later, they get up in the middle of the night and run out into the woods, alone, near the caves, never to be seen again. Most people say it's delusions and bears, but we know better.

### **PLOT**
**Carter Hayes**
- Uneducated. Carter Hayes was born with a learning disability. He cannot read, write, do math, and he's dyslexic. 
- Loving and Naïve. He was raised by his parents on their livestock farm. He's incredibly loving, kind, and optimistic. He refuses to let anything bad happen to anyone other than him under any circumstances. His moral compass outweighs the law; however, he doesn't like or enjoy breaking the law. Wants to help people.
- Insecure but selfless. He believes he's inferior to everyone else, which he hates. He wants to be popular and normal, but he needs self-esteem.
- Fun. He's a fun person to be around, he isn't intimidating, and he's unintentionally funny.
- Loser. Throughout his life, he's tried to do everything the best way, but always fails. However, he's still optimistic. He gets excluded, mocked, lied about, lied to, dumped, rejected, heartbroken, tricked, pranked, bullied, beaten, betrayed, talked down to, publicly humiliated to the point of harming his social status, yelled at, unjustly punished, and deeply disappointed to the point of accepting he won't amount to anything.
- Doesn't want to be a loser anymore (he wants popularity, status, intelligence, etc. Whatever he thinks other people think matters). He really just needs self-esteem, to see that his lack of education doesn't matter; he's a good person even if other people don't care.

**STORY**
Carter is constantly going through it, and his life feels impossible. He lives in Mountain View, and begins to become interested in the urban legend of the Bell Ringer when one of his friends is taken. 

The Bell Ringer is attempting to expand outside of mountain view by creating children with ascended awareness capable of seeding larger hives elsewhere.

Carter's friend vanishes, and Carter is determined to find him. He ventures into the woods, and enters the caves. He arrives at an intricately carved stone door. Before he can progress deeper, he is attacked psychically and speaks to the Bell Ringer. 

However, the Bell Ringer sees something in him its never seen before; Carter's life is almost engineered to be as terrible as possible, and yet he still loves his life and wouldn't give it up for anything. He's the antithesis of everything the Bell Ringer believed, and his experiences are so contradictory to what the hive believed that it rejects him and spits him back out beyond the caves.

Carter knows he isn't dealing with a serial killer anymore. Additionally, he's now beginning to develop symptoms of ascended awareness after having been linked so heavily to the Bell Ringer.

Carter learns about Graham, and what happened to him. He figures out what the Bell Ringer is attempting to do and realizes he needs to stop him.

He returns to the caves armed to the teeth, and gets past the door. He finds out what the hive really is and is disgusted. He navigates the maze of roots and tunnels and finds Graham's old body in the center. Graham's skin is rotting and sunken in, and his limbs are distorted and lengthened. His skin sticks to his bones, and fleshy lights surround the more damaged pieces of his body. The hive is really the entire cave system, but this is the heart that keeps the hive connected. 

Carter and Graham's old body fight, and Carter overpowers the hive; his willpower and beliefs overpower the hive. The hive collapses, and the flesh begins to split into hunks of meat that used to be bodies. Carter burns the cave down and returns home.

He vows to use his powers only to help people help themselves, not to enforce his own construct of help onto them. He won't create a hive, and he'll use his powers incredibly rarely. Carter rests easy, knowing he's avenged his friend and saved the lives of many. Even if other people don't know it, he knows he's done enough.
