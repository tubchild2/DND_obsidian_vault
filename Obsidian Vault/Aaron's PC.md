ASI 4: spell sniper
- Bypass half cover and 3/4 cover
- No disadvantage at close range (5ft)
- Spins with a range => 10ft gain +60ft of range

Tool Expertise
- Your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

Flash of Genius
- Whenever you or another creature you can see within 30ft of you makes an ability check or saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your INT modifier to the roll. 
- You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Magic Item Adept
- If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.

Eldritch Cannon
- Using woodcarver's tools or smith's tools, take an action to create a small or tiny cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5ft of you. A tiny one can be held in your hand, but a small one occupies its space.
- You can create one per long rest. Any further creations require expending a spell slot. You can't have more than one at a time.
- Cannon has an AC of 18, and a number of HP equal to 5 times your artificer level. Immune to poison and psychic damage. All ability scores are 10. Mending causes it to regain 2d6 hp. Disappears if reduced to 0 hp or after 1 hour.
- When you make the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also determine what type it is (see the table)
- One each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60ft of it. As part of the same bonus action, you can direct it to walk or climb up to 15 feet if it has legs.
- EXPLOSIVE CANNON: Your cannon's damage rolls increase by 1d8, and you can command the cannon to detonate if you're within 60ft of it. Detonation destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20ft of it to make a DEX save or take 3d8 force damage.
