## Rhetorical Devices
Parallelism. 
	Using multiple clauses that are grammatically parallel back-to-back. "I like skiing, snowboarding, and flying kites" instead of "I like skiing, snowboarding, and to fly kites." Makes you sound better.

Hypophora. 
	Ask a question and immediately answer it. Gets your audience to think and focus in. 

Repetition.
	Repeat a small phrase to ingrain an idea into your audiences mind. Works best when spoken, but still effective in writing. Makes something much more memorable.

Antithesis.
	Say what you don't believe to tell people what you do. Satire / verbal irony. 

Figurative Speech. 
	Anything that isn't literal. Lets the reader make new meaning, and adds nuance.
	- Metaphors. Literally stating something that isn't true to imply meaning. This *is* this. "Time is money." "Life is a roller coaster."
	- Similes. Comparison between two things using "like" or "as." "Stubborn as a mule." "Sleep like a baby."
	- Hyperbole. Exaggerates a situation, quality, or characteristic. "So hungry, I could eat a horse." "I've been waiting forever."
	- Personification. Giving human qualities to non-human things. "The trees danced in the wind." Adds more feeling and personality to a moment.

Tricolon.
	A list with three parts. Lists of 3 sound better, and stick with people.

Polysyndeton
	Repetition of a specific conjunction to stress quantity and the importance of each item in the list. “And Joshua, and all of Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had.”

Asyndeton
	The intentional and repeated omission of a conjunction.  "He went to the store to buy bread, milk, cheese, bagels." Used for rhythm, intensity, or urgency.

Juxtaposition
	Putting two opposite things together to show how different they are, and also to catch the reader's attention.

Allusion.
	Echoing another famous speech or phrase. Poem 1 is "I Hear American Singing," poem 2 is, "I, Too, Sing America." Creates a bond with the audience due to shared knowledge. Goes wrong if too obvious though. Don't cite, borrow!

Varied Sentence Length
	Short sentences jump out as powerful when mixed with long sentences. Long, long, long, long, **short!**



## Propaganda Techniques
Assertion. 
	Making bold statements. The audience is not invited to question the validity of the statements as they are delivered with confidence and enthusiasm. “Make America Great Again” is a bold statement that you aren’t invited to look further into.
	
False dilemma. 
	Claiming that there are only two answers to a problem. There is really no choice involved in such statements and the dilemma created is false. “We either stop driving SUVs, or we have global warming.”

Plain folks. 
	A generalization about the average person that groups the public together as “plain folks.” It often relies on an information gap with the public being relatively uninformed. Kind of risky when it backfires: “I write songs about driving tractors, from the comfort of a private jet.”

Name-calling and pinpointing the enemy. 
	Labelling people to give a faulty yet obvious sense of right and wrong. “Iraq, Iran, and North Korea are the axis of evil!” You don’t know anything about them but it labels them as the bad guys. The one in the audience wants to believe it because it puts them on the same team, and labels them as "good."

Simplification. 
	Simplifying a complicated situation which often results in stereotyping, distortions of truth, and opinions based on prejudice. “Immigrants” or “terrorists” or “consumers.”

Glittering generalities. 
	Words connected to abstract concepts such as freedom democracy or justice. It’s impossible to be against them. No one can argue against it. I can't be racist, I fight for truth, justice, and the American way!

Card stacking. 
	Selectively including arguments and facts that support your cause while ignoring the counter arguments. Drug commercials only include side effects because they’re forced to, and they quickly list them at the end.



## Logical Fallacies
Logical Fallacies are incorrect lines of reasoning by themselves, but are very convincing. Can be used to greatly strengthen an argument rooted in logic, but **fails on their own.**

Scare Tactics. 
	Frightening people with the exaggeration of possible dangers well beyond their statistical likelihood. Stampede legitimate fears into panic or prejudice. Appears true. If it's too crazy, people won't listen; "the CIA is irradiating our testicles with microwave radio transmissions."

Slippery Slope.
	Today's tiny missteps are tomorrow's slide into disaster. Presents a false dilemma rooted one small decision escalating over time. 

Overly Sentimental Appeals. 
	Using tender emotions to distract from facts. Often works on feelings of guilt, and seldom gives a complete picture. Chevy Commercial - Maddie. "Every 60 seconds in Africa, a minute passes. Together we can stop this!"

Bandwagon.
	Everyone's doing it! If everyone believes it, it can't be wrong! Pushes people to take the easier path.

Appeal to False Authority.
	Offering yourself or other authorities as sufficient enough for believing a claim, while misrepresenting the authority. "Michael Jordan buys this band of batteries, so should you!" Wow that's crazy; when did batteries become part of basketball?

Dogmatism.
	Asserts or assumes that a position is the only one that is acceptable. The issue for debate in the first place must be  unacceptable because one side is dogmatically correct. 

Ad Hominem.
	Attacking the person making the argument, instead of their argument. Not always wrong if they're using ethos as the basis of their reasoning. "What do you know about how much ice cream I can eat, you have 16 unpaid parking tickets."

Hasty Generalization
	Making a conclusion based on insufficient evidence. Because a few BLANK BLANK, then **all** BLANK must BLANK.

Faulty Causality / Post Hoc
	Because Y happened after X, X must have caused Y! Correlation vs. causation.

Begging the Question / Umm... Because I'm Clearly Right
	I'm right because I'm right. Assuming true the thing that's being argued. "A pound of feathers weighs less than a pound of bricks" "I can't get a C, I'm an A student!" Would this argument make sense if you didn't already agree with the conclusion.

Non Sequitur.
	When claims and points don't connect. Making the argument about something else. Very commonly used to pivot and to dodge questions. "What do you know about how much ice cream I can eat, you have 16 unpaid parking tickets" also works here, because it pivots from the amount of ice cream one should eat to the qualifications of the opponent. The key here, is that it could still technically be related.

Straw Man
	Attacking an argument no one is making / twisting the opponents argument into something easier to dismantle and then attacking that. (against someone who hates bears) "Oh, so you hate all wildlife? You want global warming to happen?"

Red Herring / Whataboutism
	A change in subject or irrelevant claim designed to throw readers off. A distraction. Unlike a non-sequitur, this is completely unrelated. It's something for people to chase to waste their time. “Why did I get marked down on that question?” “Because you should be more focused on how you’re behaving in class.” "What about that guy? Don't look at me!"
