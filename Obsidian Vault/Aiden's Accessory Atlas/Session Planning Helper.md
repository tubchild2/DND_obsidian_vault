## Tips
- End on a cliffhanger
- Give players a goal
- Don't send them on a goose chase--let them go on one themselves
- Keep notes brief
- It's fine if they don't progress the plot
- Keep sessions to what they're interested in
- Outline, don't plan
- Focus on roleplay--don't drag it out. Cut optional things.
- Don't create conflict for the sake of conflict.
- Make NPCs helpful unless necessary
- Start each session by painting an immersive picture

Cities should be simple, and distinctly themed with a visual component, that's gameplay first. It should be filled with cool themed experiences that appeal to your players (not all shops). Don't worry too much about details or realism unless they relate to gameplay.
