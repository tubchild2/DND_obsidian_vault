**Carter Hayes**
Summary
- Uneducated. Carter Hayes was born with a learning disability. He cannot read, write, do math, and he's dyslexic. 
- Loving and Naïve. He was raised by his parents on their livestock farm. He's incredibly loving, kind, and optimistic. He refuses to let anything bad happen to anyone other than him under any circumstances. His moral compass outweighs the law; however, he doesn't like or enjoy breaking the law. Wants to help people.
- Insecure but selfless. He believes he's inferior to everyone else, which he hates. He wants to be popular and normal, but he needs self-esteem.
- Fun. He's a fun person to be around, he isn't intimidating, and he's unintentionally funny.
- Loser. Throughout his life, he's tried to do everything the best way, but always fails. However, he's still optimistic. He gets excluded, mocked, lied about, lied to, dumped, rejected, heartbroken, tricked, pranked, bullied, beaten, betrayed, talked down to, publicly humiliated to the point of harming his social status, yelled at, unjustly punished, and deeply disappointed to the point of accepting he won't amount to anything.
- Doesn't want to be a loser anymore (he wants popularity, status, intelligence, etc. Whatever he thinks other people think matters). He really just needs self-esteem, to see that his lack of education doesn't matter; he's a good person even if other people don't care.
Inspired by:
- Charlie Reynolds (stupidity, humor)
- Clark Kent (morality)
- Matt from the "JOE SCHMO SHOW" (exploited innocence)
- Steve Harrington (fall from grace, redemption, endurance)
- Johnny B. Goode

**Beckett Tomita**
- Nerd. He's the kind of dude to get straight A's. He's not Tony Stark, and he's not a genius. Math and science are his primary hobbies and what he centers his life around. He gets things wrong, and he's not an encyclopedia. He's also not quick-witted, meaning a lot of this stuff takes him time to do well. 
- Prideful and annoying. He's egotistical and a little narcissistic. Will hold you in a conversation because he thinks you'll like what he's saying. He's still understanding of people and won't assume they're idiots or anything.
- Ethically flexible. He believes in the concept of the "greater good," and will let bad things happen if it means preventing worse things. He's a good person, just pragmatic and opinionated. He'll always take the blame for these types of decisions.
- Careful. Doesn't like to take risks, and doesn't like to lose. If the game is someone else's, he stops playing.
- Frequently Bullied. In a non-professional setting, people don't like him very much. He's pretty annoying.
- Hateful. If he doesn't like you, he really doesn't like you. He's one to hold grudges and try to get even.
- Loyal. If he likes you, he really likes you. He'll stand up for people, fight for them, and break his no-risks rule for them.
- Dork. His sense of humor is incredibly silly and he snorts when he laughs. He loves to laugh.
Inspired by:
- Dustin Henderson (dork, bullied, a little prideful, nerd)
- Magneto (bad for the greater good)
- Kevin Flynn (stops playing if it's someone else's game)
- Tony Stark (tactical and justified revenge seeker)
- Samwise Gamgee (fiercely loyal)

**Wade Kyou**
- Charismatic. Con artist. Quick witted. Steals, lies, tricks, and brawls.
- Impulsive. Reckless. Has lots of enemies and burned bridges. Takes risks. Has little restraint. He doesn't always get away, and has several scars (both physical and mental) from his experiences.
- A physical man that appreciates quick pleasures like money and adventure. He has no religion, has no friends or family, has no permanent residence, and has nothing of tangible substance. He has a void where God and love usually go that he's filling with money and excitement; it's not doing a great job.
- Good but selfish. Has a functioning moral compass, but it's more of an honor among thieves type thing. He will double cross and manipulate people for selfish gain if they deserve it. He has lines he won't cross (kids, pets, debt slaves, sexual exploitation, etc.)
- Came from an abusive household that he ran away from. He was homeless for a time, so he learned to take care of himself and improvise. He's afraid of close relationships, especially marriage, and has completely rejected that lifestyle because of his upbringing and its effects on him. Was found and taken by social services and adopted by a different family for the rest of his childhood.
Inspired by:
- Nathan Drake (charismatic, impulsive, thieves' code, lines he won't cross)
- Jayne Cobb (physical man, double crosses if deserved)
- Frank Abagnale Jr. (clever, con man)

**Documentary Series Superhero**
- "Yeah so usually, I feel, like in comics and stuff, most superheroes operate for 3-6 years. I've been going for about 11 now. Usually they kind of cap out power wise at a certain point, but for me I've just kept going. Most of my super villains gave up, which really hurts my feelings if you really think about it because a super hero and a villain have kind of a partnership thing going on and it's like oh what I'm not interesting to go up against anymore? Anyways, yeah the city doesn't really like sending me in cause I'm not really the best option most of the time. Most of the other heroes I knew have retired by now and most of them don't really hang out anymore. Whenever a super villain does show up the city will typically have to call me, but only if the police for sure can't handle it. They've gotten pretty good at taking them down after all this time. I don't know, it's kind of gotten pretty dull at this point."
