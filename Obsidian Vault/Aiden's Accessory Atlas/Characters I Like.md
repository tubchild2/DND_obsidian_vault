**Beckett Tomita**
- Nerd. He's the kind of dude to get straight A's. He's not Tony Stark, and he's not a genius. Math and science are his primary hobbies and what he centers his life around. He gets things wrong, and he's not an encyclopedia. He's also not quick-witted, meaning a lot of this stuff takes him time to do well. 
- Prideful and annoying. He's egotistical and a little narcissistic. Will hold you in a conversation because he thinks you'll like what he's saying. He's still understanding of people and won't assume they're idiots or anything.
- Ethically flexible. He believes in the concept of the "greater good," and will let bad things happen if it means preventing worse things. He's a good person, just pragmatic and opinionated. He'll always take the blame for these types of decisions.
- Careful. Doesn't like to take risks, and doesn't like to lose. If the game is someone else's, he stops playing.
- Frequently Bullied. In a non-professional setting, people don't like him very much. He's pretty annoying.
- Hateful. If he doesn't like you, he really doesn't like you. He's one to hold grudges and try to get even.
- Loyal. If he likes you, he really likes you. He'll stand up for people, fight for them, and break his no-risks rule for them.
- Dork. His sense of humor is incredibly silly and he snorts when he laughs. He loves to laugh.
Inspired by:
- Dustin Henderson (dork, bullied, a little prideful, nerd)
- Magneto (bad for the greater good)
- Kevin Flynn (stops playing if it's someone else's game)
- Tony Stark (tactical and justified revenge seeker)
- Samwise Gamgee (fiercely loyal)

**Wade Kyou**
- Charismatic. Con artist. Quick witted. Steals, lies, tricks, and brawls.
- Impulsive. Reckless. Has lots of enemies and burned bridges. Takes risks. Has little restraint. He doesn't always get away, and has several scars (both physical and mental) from his experiences.
- A physical man that appreciates quick pleasures like money and adventure. He has no religion, has no friends or family, has no permanent residence, and has nothing of tangible substance. He has a void where God and love usually go that he's filling with money and excitement; it's not doing a great job.
- Good but selfish. Has a functioning moral compass, but it's more of an honor among thieves type thing. He will double cross and manipulate people for selfish gain if they deserve it. He has lines he won't cross (kids, pets, debt slaves, sexual exploitation, etc.)
- Came from an abusive household that he ran away from. He was homeless for a time, so he learned to take care of himself and improvise. He's afraid of close relationships, especially marriage, and has completely rejected that lifestyle because of his upbringing and its effects on him. Was found and taken by social services and adopted by a different family for the rest of his childhood.
Inspired by:
- Nathan Drake (charismatic, impulsive, thieves' code, lines he won't cross)
- Jayne Cobb (physical man, double crosses if deserved)
- Frank Abagnale Jr. (clever, con man)
