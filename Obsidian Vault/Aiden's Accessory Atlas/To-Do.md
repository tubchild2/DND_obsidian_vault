A dishonest documentary. Basically a reality show.

A man living in a simulation learns the truth. He becomes angry and depressed. He loses motivation to do anything, and becomes deeply nihilistic. The truth he eventually arrives at is terrifying, and hopeful. He realizes that the lines between reality and fiction are blurred to the point of not existing; what goes on within the simulation at this point is almost more real than what's going on out there. The "realest" thing about both "in here" and "out there" are the people, and that's remained in tact. So... it doesn't matter? He tries to be content and make the best of the situation. The question I ask about the script, is, would that be enough? Or would the doubt about reality stress them so much that they have to get out?

TTRPG where only one person is a real player. Carefully scripted. Have a player get truman showed / Joe Schmo Showed. All of the other players are heavily scripted.
