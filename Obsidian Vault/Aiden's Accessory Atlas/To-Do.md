- [ ] Grand Plot Plan
	- [ ] A Unabomber esc character that hates [[advanced eterology]]. He uses moral anti-realism to justify murder and terrorism. There is no such thing as good or bad--instead, there are actions that are deemed one way based on societal or personal preferences. He wants the world to return to its more natural state before the influence of [[advanced eterology]], and he'll accomplish that via terrorism.
