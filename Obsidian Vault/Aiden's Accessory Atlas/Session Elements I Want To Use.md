### False Betrayal
Create a situation that pushes players to panic and turn on each other.

Required points:
- Good reason for finger pointing
	- Could have been done by a player
	- Player would've had a rational motive
	- No / very few other NPC culprits
	- Feels like something a player did (imperfect, rushed, improvised, weird details)
	- Every player is a potential suspect (separate players)
- Time limit
- Consequences for being accused 
	- Make them panic
	- Threaten their lives
- Limited options beyond finger pointing
	- Best option is deduction
	- Deduction is possible
- Good reason to turn on each other
	- Don't make the characters close
	- Give players a reason to distrust each other
	- Competition, different objectives, limited resources, etc.
- Give them tangible yet Sisyphean ways to progress the mystery
	- Mystery web that takes too long to solve
	- Provide a lot of information, but not enough to figure it out
	- Clues should stir the pot
	- Create an out in case they figure it out
	- Don't tie it to actual media so they can't figure it out
- Conclusions
	- The main theme is trust. If they'd trusted each other, they'd have succeeded. If they hadn't, they would've died.

### Crawl of the Navigators
See [[Crawl of the Navigator]].

### True Betrayal
Create a situation in which one player actively hides their true intentions and works for the antagonists. Build it up over time, make it reasonable, and make the reveal as devastating as possible.

### Gardener's Conflict
Create a situation in which two groups of people have conflicting sets of reliable information and motives. Push them to form separate opinions on an important matter. Have the players argue. 

## Navigator
One player has a key piece of immovable information that they need to communicate to a mobile player. For example, one player has a map and a radio, and the other player needs to listen to their instructions. The spice comes from the hazards, task management, stress, and things that're difficult to explain.

Inspired by: Stranger Things Season 2 Episode 8 : The Mind Flayer. Stuck in the lab with demo-dogs, underpowered, forced separation due to skill differences.

### Bell Ringer
Cosmic horror element with a focus on dread. A lot of people die in it, there's a lot of focus on time and graveyards. It's the existential crisis of tabletop. What should you do with your time? Should you fear death? How do other people react to death? Just a whole lot of death. It's got great emotional weight and is a good setup for a lot of great stories. I shy away from it a lot: why not go all in?

### Caribbean of the Stars
- Setting: pirate ambush in an asteroid belt. 
- While flying through an asteroid belt, the crew is ambushed by a massive crew of pirates (they easily outnumber them 10-1).
- Objective: Fight them off, negotiate, or escape capture.
- Goal: unstoppable, "holy crap how are we alive," pudding-in-your-pants action. Gunfights, shootouts, explosions, twists, complications, and more happen extremely fast to keep you on your toes.

### The Plague of the LMS-66
- Setting: dead space station recently infected by [[Bane]]. 
- The crew discovers a derelict space station carrying thousands of credits worth of cargo. However, once they're too far in, and greatly separated, and contact has been lost between them, they realize that the station was infected by [[Bane]] 2 months ago. One third of the infected are alive, ravenous, and hunting them. 
- Objective: survive with as much loot as you can carry.
- Goal: induce more horror than the Bunker of Wyrm's Rest. Separate players, create a compelling mystery, build dread, place tense situations, and drop jumpscares by the hordes of infected.
- Towards the end, they uncover the radio station where the last survivors were hiding out. They had recorded a transmission from deep space: from far beyond where any man had ever gone. They didn't know what it was; it sounded kind of like deep breathing, a pulsing heartbeat like sound, and warbling beeping. It was an incredibly powerful transmission. They wrote, "SOS to the world. SOS to the world. SOS to the world. 10:44pm standard time, January 17th, 2644. Signals. Signals from the deep. Estimated 60 trillion kilometers from point of contact. Infected aboard the LMS. Allen likes to play with fire. Allen likes it, Nyla. SOS SOS SOS. Integrity failing. How did he find the door? No man enters the gates unsafe. How did they crawl so fast? SOS SOS SOS. Red port panic, red port panic. Fifty-five. Fifty-five. Please come in. SOS SOS SOS."

### Imperium
- Setting: High society independent gathering. 
- The crew needs to acquire something from a cruel businessman during one of his cocktail parties. He's hired several Imperium samurai to protect him.
- Objective: sneak, solve, charm, and takedown. They're outnumbered, so they need to do this heist quickly and effectively.
- Goal: make the players hate the businessman, and love some of the visitors. End with a climactic Samurai duel.

### Whiteout Outpost
- Setting: abandoned [[House Arai]] laboratory hidden deep in the arctic. 
- The crew discovers a laboratory containing hundreds of thousands of credits worth of advanced technology just sitting in the arctic. As they enter, they find it to be a Claustrophobic, disgusting, unsettling, mysterious, biopunk nightmare. 
- Objective: find a way to free the surviving clones, hybrids, and cyborgs while surviving / destroying the defective ones. Maybe make it out with some loot if possible.
- Goal: induce gross-out reactions, intrigue from the mystery, and cautious exploration. Horror / Wonder

### The Losing Side, Maybe, Still Not Convinced It Was The Wrong One.
- Setting: confederate prison ship
- The crew is apprehended by [[The Confederacy]] and separated. Each one is interrogated, and going to be imprisoned or enslaved.
- Objective: keep their wits, find a way to communicate, and escape. 
- Goal: make players roleplay as much as possible. Escape requires excellent roleplay and creativity.

### Early
- Setting: crew's ship
- The crew's ship is boarded by a bounty hunter while they're asleep. He has a complex plan that includes setting multiple traps to get his hands on someone aboard the ship. He has an unbelievable advantage. 
- Objective: sneak, avoid traps, and catch the bounty hunter before he completes his plan.
- Goal: don't go for horror, make it as tense as possible. Make players deeply terrified of losing what they have, or getting captured by this horrible, horrible man.

### Adrift
- Setting: crew's ship
- The ship is heavily damaged while in the middle of nowhere. They're stranded and have no hope of calling for help. They're running out of oxygen, and the escape pod can only take 2 people. 
- Objective: try to fix the ship, or make unthinkable decisions before an **actual timer** runs out.
- Goal: make someone cry. Desperation, heartbreak, and moral dilemmas. After establishing this found family, tear them apart.

### Honor Among Thieves
- Setting: the location of the treasure.
- After identifying the location of the treasure, it becomes readily apparent that if they turned on each other, they'd have a significantly easier time and get way more money. 
- Objective: stay honorable, stay together.
- Goal: push the players to be dishonorable as much as possible. If they choose honor, it needs to be earned to feel like a satisfying ending. If they choose greed, then they weren't better than anyone else after all.

### Terminal Lucidity
Inspired by real story.
An Arabic man attempted suicide by fire, leaving his body scorched. He was rushed to the hospital, and hours before he died, he began walking around and kicking things. It was a rare case of terminal lucidity. A burn victim walking with shocking comprehension and strength before death is incredibly creepy.

### Truly Alien
Inspired by Super Metroid's alien atmosphere. Intense vivid colors, unknowable organisms. Things you can't understand fully, and won't. Long drawn out deep chords. Melodies that feel off and incomplete.
