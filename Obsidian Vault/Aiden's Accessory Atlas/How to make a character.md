Personality Gimmicks
Backstory
What's their goal and why?

Tips:
- Don't make them antisocial or violent unless you're very experienced and your DM is ok with it.
- Make sure they care about the world and have something to lose.
- Good gimmicks are something you can always fall back on in roleplay, not something situational. Be broad.
- You get +1 proficiency or +1 to an ability score of your choice for making a fleshed out backstory.
