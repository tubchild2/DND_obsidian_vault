### The Tips
1. Remain impartial to ensure player agency. 
2. Take notes throughout the session.
3. Encourage roleplay and "rule of cool" use.
4. Narrate slowly for impactful moments.
5. Don't alter dice rolls.
6. Skill checks for skills that don't exist can use combinations. For example, Theochemy is Arcana and Religion. The DC increases by 1.5x
7. Use physical props for immersion and fun.
8. End sessions on cliffhangers.
9. Have NPCs encourage roleplay with questions, and have them do things when the PCs aren't around.
10. Show, don't tell.

### Balancing Combat
1. Incorporate battlefield actions. Battlefield actions actions happen at the end of the monster's turn, and provide a tell for what they're going to do next turn. This gives the players a chance to adapt and dynamically interact with them to neutralize the action. They come in many shapes and sizes.
