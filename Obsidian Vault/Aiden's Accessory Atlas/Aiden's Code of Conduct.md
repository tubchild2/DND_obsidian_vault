### Rules
**#1 The Ephesians 5:3-4 Principle.** 
Try to steer clear of perverse, graphic, racist, or other extremely offensive material. Some jokes are fine, but there's a massive gap between a joke and something that'd get you slapped if you said it in public.

**#2 Hosting**
Let’s shoot for a different host every few games. No one should be hosting more than two games in a row.

**#3 PVP Combat**
If you wish to fight another player, they have to agree to it. If you attack without their permission, the target gets to decide if it hits or not.

**#4 Character Creation**
Multiclassing is allowed. All characters start at level 1. We’ll use the standard array for ability scores for balancing reasons.

**#5 Using My Setting for Other Sessions**
You can use my world, but whatever story you intend to tell has to follow two basic guidelines. First, it can’t use any pre-established parties, and second, it can’t operate on a scale that could roadblock other DMs in the world. For example, don’t threaten the world with a cataclysmic event

**#6 New Recruits**
New players can join, but they have to be voted in by the majority of the group.

### Punishments:
I'm not firm enough with my punishments, so your punishments will be collectively decided by the entire group. Whatever they decide will go into instant effect. If you keep violating the rules, though, you'll be asked to leave. 

### Expectations
**The Rule of Cool**
- If something is cool, but not technically allowed by the rules, I'll fudge the numbers to make it possible. 
- Example: using sleep on a cup of water to make a sleep potion. That's not how sleep works but it's cool, balanced, and it encourages roleplay.

**Character Based Storytelling**
- Please try to make and play a well-made character. 
- This takes a lot of the pressure off me, and is more fun generally.
