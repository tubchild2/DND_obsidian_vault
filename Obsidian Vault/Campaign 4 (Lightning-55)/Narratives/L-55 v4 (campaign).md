You are a member of a ragtag group of scavengers very near the bottom of the criminal hierarchy. You’re after whatever treasure you can find, and you’re not in the business of saving the world, nor does the fate of the system revolve around you. You’re in for a sincere, atmosphere, light adventure with a group of loyal scumbags.

The crew is after a lost stockpile of wealth that vanished during the fall of the old world. The focus is on the **human stories**more than the lost treasure. 

Each Adventure will be a self contained adventure with a primary focus on where they go, who they meet, and what they do to get the treasure. The treasure itself isn't important or special, it's just some lost treasure.

**Werewolf**
- Setting: crew's ship
- The crew visits a dirt-poor town, and 4 strangers pay top-dollar to get transport to a distant moon. While in flight, separate the players. One of the strangers ends up dead, everyone is missing stuff, and someone made a distress call to the confederacy, endangering their entire operation. 
- Objective: figure out who it is before the Confederacy intercepts their ship.
- Goal: make it seem like this wasn't planned, and like one of the players is guilty. Plant seeds of distrust and get the players to turn on each other. Ultimately, show that if they had just trusted one another, a lot of chaos could've been avoided.

**Caribbean of the Stars**
- Setting: pirate ambush in an asteroid belt. 
- While flying through an asteroid belt, the crew is ambushed by a massive crew of pirates (they easily outnumber them 10-1).
- Objective: Fight them off, negotiate, or escape capture.
- Goal: unstoppable, "holy crap how are we alive," pudding-in-your-pants action. Gunfights, shootouts, explosions, twists, complications, and more happen extremely fast to keep you on your toes.

**The Plague of the LMS-66**
- Setting: dead space station recently infected by Bane. 
- The crew discovers a derelict space station carrying thousands of credits worth of cargo. However, once they're too far in, and greatly separated, and contact has been lost between them, they realize that the station was infected by Bane 2 months ago. One third of the infected are alive, ravenous, and hunting them. 
- Objective: survive with as much loot as you can carry.
- Goal: induce more horror than the Bunker of Wyrm's Rest. Separate players, create a compelling mystery, build dread, place tense situations, and drop jumpscares by the hordes of infected.
- Towards the end, they uncover the radio station where the last survivors were hiding out. They had recorded a transmission from deep space: from far beyond where any man had ever gone. They didn't know what it was; it sounded kind of like deep breathing, a pulsing heartbeat like sound, and warbling beeping. It was an incredibly powerful transmission. They wrote, "SOS to the world. SOS to the world. SOS to the world. 10:44pm standard time, January 17th, 2644. Signals. Signals from the deep. Estimated 60 trillion kilometers from point of contact. Infected aboard the LMS. Allen likes to play with fire. Allen likes it, Nyla. SOS SOS SOS. Integrity failing. How did he find the door? No man enters the gates unsafe. How did they crawl so fast? SOS SOS SOS. Red port panic, red port panic. Fifty-five. Fifty-five. Please come in. SOS SOS SOS."

**Imperium**
- Setting: High society independent gathering. 
- The crew needs to acquire something from a cruel businessman during one of his cocktail parties. He's hired several Imperium samurai to protect him.
- Objective: sneak, solve, charm, and takedown. They're outnumbered, so they need to do this heist quickly and effectively.
- Goal: make the players hate the businessman, and love some of the visitors. End with a climactic Samurai duel.

**Whiteout Outpost**
- Setting: abandoned House Arai laboratory hidden deep in the arctic. 
- The crew discovers a laboratory containing hundreds of thousands of credits worth of advanced technology just sitting in the arctic. As they enter, they find it to be a Claustrophobic, disgusting, unsettling, mysterious, biopunk nightmare. 
- Objective: find a way to free the surviving clones, hybrids, and cyborgs while surviving / destroying the defective ones. Maybe make it out with some loot if possible.
- Goal: induce gross-out reactions, intrigue from the mystery, and cautious exploration. Horror / Wonder

**The Losing Side, Maybe, Still Not Convinced It Was The Wrong One.**
- Setting: confederate prison ship
- The crew is apprehended by the confederacy and separated. Each one is interrogated, and going to be imprisoned or enslaved.
- Objective: keep their wits, find a way to communicate, and escape. 
- Goal: make players roleplay as much as possible. Escape requires excellent roleplay and creativity.

**Early**
- Setting: crew's ship
- The crew's ship is boarded by a bounty hunter while they're asleep. He has a complex plan that includes setting multiple traps to get his hands on someone aboard the ship. He has an unbelievable advantage. 
- Objective: sneak, avoid traps, and catch the bounty hunter before he completes his plan.
- Goal: don't go for horror, make it as tense as possible. Make players deeply terrified of losing what they have, or getting captured by this horrible, horrible man.

**Adrift**
- Setting: crew's ship
- The ship is heavily damaged while in the middle of nowhere. They're stranded and have no hope of calling for help. They're running out of oxygen, and the escape pod can only take 2 people. 
- Objective: try to fix the ship, or make unthinkable decisions before an **actual timer** runs out.
- Goal: make someone cry. Desperation, heartbreak, and moral dilemmas. After establishing this found family, tear them apart.

**Honor Among Thieves**
- Setting: the location of the treasure.
- After identifying the location of the treasure, it becomes readily apparent that if they turned on each other, they'd have a significantly easier time and get way more money. 
- Objective: stay honorable, stay together.
- Goal: push the players to be dishonorable as much as possible. If they choose honor, it needs to be earned to feel like a satisfying ending. If they choose greed, then they weren't better than anyone else after all.
