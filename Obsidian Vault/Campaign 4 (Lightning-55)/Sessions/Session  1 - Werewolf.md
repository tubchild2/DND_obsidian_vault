# Pre-Session 
### Plot/Goals  
Part 1: The Setup
- Read immersive opening one. (They're on their way to Venus to meet Dr. Matheny who's hired them for a smuggling job)
- Introduce players. Plant seeds of doubt centered around those secrets they created.

Part 2: Venus
- Venus is a desert world. Vegetation is sparse, sand rolls in, and most people are suspicious weirdos. They land at Port Worst. Dr. Matheny is inside the town in a bar called Dirtmouth. 
- Dr. Matheny introduces himself, and invites them to sit. He's offering 50,000 credits for a 7 day trip from Venus to Neptune. He's transporting something that he can't disclose, and he requires that no questions be asked. 
- Whatever he's transporting is stored within a large black metal crate that occasionally pulses. with energy. He lugs it back onto the ship and takes it to a spare room.

Part 3: The Ship
- Introduce them to the functionality of the ship. (See [[The Lightning-55 (DOC)]])
- Let them explore the ship
	- Point out unimportant things that people are doing in a way the seems like they possess greater significance.
	- Imply secrets being kept between the GM and the players beyond the standard ones.
	- Start rumors. Dr. Matheny says things like, "I know what kind of man you really are." or "I know how you think."
	- Plant ambiguous evidence / unresolved details. 
		- There's a bunch of meat in the fridge that's leaking blood.
		- There's a half burned note in the trash.
		- There are scratch or knife marks outside the vent covers.
		- There's a full katana lying across the floor of the engine room.
		- There's a trail of water droplets around the escape pod.
- Dinner Time
	- Dr. Matheny cooks chicken for everyone.
	- Dr. Matheny is quiet, and then he asks everyone what their biggest fears are.
	- Dr. Matheny is scared of space. When he was a child, he used to listen to the signals from space at night up on the hill by his home. One night, he overheard something from far beyond the solar system, something impossibly old. It sounded human, like a distress call. Someone was calling to him from the deep, but there couldn't have been anyone out there. He didn't sleep that night, and he's been afraid of space ever since.

Part 4: The Inciting Incident
- Everyone is separated. Each player can privately do however much they want to before going to bed. This is the only time where you won't be observed by your fellow cremates. Everyone privately message me what you'd like to do on discord (in case of overlap), and then I'll give each of you like 6 minutes to go through it. Keep your stats on you, in case I need to make checks.

- Events
	1. You hear footsteps beyond your line of sight. Someone was observing you and sprinted away.
	2. You hear a faint beeping red light coming from the ship's radio in the console room. Somebody just contacted the confederacy, they told them about the cargo, the position of the ship, and who's on board. The confederacy is on their way, and will arrive at their position in an hour. They have you outgunned and outnumbered. They will imprison, enslave, or execute everyone on board.
	3. You notice a bloodied knife in the trash can.
	4. You hear muffled screaming coming the bedrooms. It appears Dr. Matheny's room door was left half-opened. Dr. Matheny's bloodied corpse lies sprawled across the floor. He was stabbed to death in his room. All of his credits are gone, the weapon was taken, and the metal box he was carrying has been opened and emptied.
	5. You see all of the ship's cameras all simultaneously power down. Someone erased the security camera footage, and disabled them.
	6. You hear the engine power down and the ship halt in place. Someone used the Captain's lock to disable the engine. They changed the password. It can't be hacked without damaging the ship.
	7. You notice the sound of a muffled conversation through the ventilation system. Two people are fiercely arguing, but you can't discern what they're saying.
- Gather the crew back together.

Part 5: The Witch Hunt
- "If my notes are correct, here's the situation spelled out plain and simple"
	- Your ship is dead in space because the engine was disabled by someone who changed the password. 
	- They stole a bunch of stuff and killed killed Dr. Matheny.
	- This person took out the cameras and contacted the confederacy.
	- The confederacy is going to board your ship in one hour. 
- From my perspective, as the GM, you have a few options:
	- You can figure out who did it and either execute them with the airlock, leave them behind, or try to get the engine password out of them.
	- You can hunker down and attempt to fight off the confederacy as a team with a severe disadvantage.
	- You can turn on each other and take the pod for yourselves, dooming everyone else on board.
- Start the 1 hour real-time timer.
- Don't reveal any more info because that's meta gaming.
- They'll point fingers, they'll defend themselves out of not wanting to reveal their secrets or have their rooms searched. Things will escalate.
- The session ends when the timer runs out because "I didn't plan for this."
