Timeline:
- 320 years ago, the Great Houses began to form; each one oversees a massive corporation. The 20 largest Houses were incorporated into the Sultanate; the grand government of the newly terraformed and colonized solar system. They write in Kanji, and speak in a combination of Japanese and English.
- 160 years ago, a pandemic began centered around a disease known as 'bane.' Bane functions by weaponizing cellular mitosis. It causes the body to begin to grow rapidly and uncontrollably, leading to the formation of tumors, cysts, deformities, and mutations. It causes exhaustion, pain, and hunger. It kills you in 3 months, and drives you mad in 1. It's bloodborne, meaning if you're even grazed by an infected or exposed to a single drop of their blood, you will die.
- 80 years ago, Bane wiped out 80% of the system's population. No one native to Europa survived the outbreak. Sultanate controlled Tokyo and the House controlled Earth cities maintained their opulence, but the lack of resources and established trade routes caused mass starvation and strife. Surviving villages and towns cobbled together independent governments and technologically reverted to Feudal Japan. Advanced technology was far too expensive. Since no cure could be made for Bane, the infected were forced into camps on the outskirts of civilization to die.
- 40 years ago, the Great Houses used the scarcity of resources to make massive profits by jacking up their prices. The Sultanate began attempting to reestablish control of the system through military occupation and fostering dependence through well paying jobs. Some independents formed a rebellion against the Sultanate, making use of improvised weapons, traps, and the environment to outthink Sultanate weapons. The rebels believe in a world of independently operating planets and moons, and they don't care what they have to do to get it. They're violent, amoral people that are arguably more dangerous than the Sultanate. The Sultanate is corrupt, greedy, and kills freely to occupy more land, and the Rebels are violent, anarchic, and sometimes do more harm than good when separating towns from Sultanate resources. 
- 20 years ago, House Kagutsuchi, the house specializing in bioengineering, rolled out its latest line of products. First, the clones. Clones are bred for their roles, be it slavery, combat, or prostitution. They're bred to be obedient, and have little to no autonomy. Additionally, they're selling new "Infusions," which alter your genetic makeup to grant you the strength, speed, or intelligence of their clones. Just now, they finished developing rudimentary cybernetic implants. They're nothing special, but they'll do the same thing as the infusions in a less-elegant but cheaper way. Lastly, their hybridization program has allowed them to create pets, guard animals, and monsters. All of these things are incredibly expensive commodities. 
- 10 years ago, Myths began circulating about a creature that exists in deep space. As the legend goes, whenever it approaches, the ship goes dark and the windows seal shut. It supposedly latches onto the ship and enters through the portholes. None that have seen it have lived, as it doesn't just attack ships, it makes them vanish. Space-farers have begun referring to it as "the famine." Myths like these began popping up throughout the system; they tell tales about gods, monsters, and unknowable creatures very similar to Japanese folklore.
- Today, In this world, you need to get money, get food, and stay alive. Money is scarce, and resources scarcer. For those living where they can't farm or fish, self-sufficiency is impossible, meaning that most are willing to cross lines if it means survival. Firearms and explosives are incredibly expensive, meaning most use katanas, naginatas, bows, shurikens, and tontos to defend what's theirs.
