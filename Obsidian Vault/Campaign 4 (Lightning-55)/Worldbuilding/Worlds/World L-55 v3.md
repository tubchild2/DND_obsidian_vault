Premise:
- Space pirates
- Visually reminiscent of traditional southeast Asia

Timeline:
2440 (era of hope)
- The Imperium formed as a combination of Japan / China and America / Europe. Japanese was the agreed upon written language, and spoken word is a combination of English and Japanese. Their capital is Tokyo.
- The largest corporations fell under the control of wealthy families. They were incorporated into the Imperium as the Great Houses.
- The Imperium colonized the planets and moons of our solar system. There are 8 planets, and 20+ moons. 
- House Kagutsuchi rolled out their newest line of bioengineered products; 
	- Clones. Clones can be bred for any given task, but the 3 most common are slavery, combat, and prostitution. They're bred to lack autonomy, but they aren't completely obedient. 
	- Infusions. These expensive injections alter your genetic makeup to grant you strength, speed, intelligence, or more.
	- Implants. These are cheaper, and less elegant versions of the infusions. Metal fused to flesh that increases your performance.
	- Hybrids. Through use of their cloning and breeding technology, they learned to create new species through combinations of previously created genetic building blocks. They've created pets like the cat-dog, guard animals like the hippo-dog, monsters like the man-bear, and more.

2640 (the fall of civilization)
- Bane, a pandemic started on Europa, spread silently throughout the system. On November 11th, commonly referred to as Chi No Hi, or the day of blood, the infected across the system began to display symptoms. 
- Bane weaponizes cellular mitosis to maximize its count within a given body. Muscle and bone deformities, tumors, cysts, blood clots, and mutations all begin to erupt 7 days after infection. Shortly thereafter, you become contagious. 1 month after infection, you begin to exhibit symptoms of madness and aggression brought about by the pain, paranoia, and hunger. After 3 months, you die, as your bones pierce your vital organs and you die of internal bleeding. If a single drop of their blood touches you, you will die. This wouldn't be that bad if they weren't covered in bloody deformities. The body simply cannot fight it; infection is a death sentence, no matter what. 
- Over the next 3 months, 88% of humanity died. Tokyo, cities controlled by the Great Houses, and those not native to populated sectors survived. Everyone else was left to rot as nature reclaimed major civilizations.

2643 (a bad attempt to reconstruct)
- The lack of functional trade routes, the lack of resources, and the lack of infrastructure led to mass starvation and strife. The improvised governments of the surviving towns and villages were left to fend for themselves.
- Bane was rarer, allowing survivors to quickly execute or exile them. Regardless of which, their bodies ended up in camps outside of populated sectors.
- Technologically speaking, majority of the system (not Earth) reverted back to feudal Japan. Anything beyond that was far too rare and expensive. 
- The Imperium attempted to reclaim the control of the system by fostering dependence on their resources, jobs, and through military occupation. The Great Houses saw an opportunity to profit, so they jacked up their prices. Them and the Imperium as a whole are corrupt, greedy, and merciless.
- Some of the now-independent groups resisted the Imperium; they blame the Imperium for the mass death due to them taking 3 years to respond. They're violent, anarchic, and believe in independence from the Imperium which occasionally does more harm than good (lack of Imperium resources is a death sentence)
- For everyone else, the focus became money, food, and water. Money is scarce, and resources scarcer. Most people cannot sustain themselves, especially if they can't farm or fish. So, if you want to stay alive, you need to cross some lines. You can either work for the Imperium, or turn to a life of piracy. Most choose option 2.

2660
- Resources are scarce
- Most people are living a life akin to Feudal Japan
- Guns, bombs, and ships are incredibly expensive.
- Pretty much everyone is desperate, a pirate, or working with the Imperium
- Most people hate the Imperium, yet everyone is desperate. So, you either join them, attempt to make it on your own, or become a pirate and have to fend them off. Fending them off isn't easy, they have access to cutting edge weapons, ships, infusions, hybrids, clones, and implants. And yet, hatred of the Imperium is so strong, that way more people choose piracy. Pirates, though flawed and cruel, are symbols of freedom in a world that's being slowly dominated by the greedy and controlling Imperium.
- The motto, "take care of your own" takes on a whole new meaning. Being a parent or any kind of leader during this day and age is unreal, but a culture of respect and honor among thieves has resurfaced.
- There's an agreed upon cease-fire every year on Chi No Hi to honor those who died 20 years prior.
