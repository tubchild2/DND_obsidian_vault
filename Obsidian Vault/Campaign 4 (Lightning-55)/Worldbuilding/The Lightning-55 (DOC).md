Control Room.
- Pilot the ship
- use security cameras
- contact anyone nearby
- Whatever you do, don't contact the Confederacy because you're carrying illegal cargo and they don't take prisoners. They can hunt you down in an hour real-time.

Kitchen. 
- Cook food
- meet with the crew. 
- It's the heart of the ship.

Bedrooms
- Each of you have one, and everyone should stay out because it's your personal private business. 
- There are also spare rooms. 
- Each room has a bathroom.

Cargo bay. 
- Enter and exit the ship, 
- store any cargo,
- You can trap people in the airlock and expel them into space. Some people still do that. 

Engine room. 
- You'll likely spend next to no time here. 
- I did add one cool thing; ships of this style have a captain's lock; by entering a password you can shut the engine down. This is commonly used as a negotiation tactic. The password is currently set to '1234' and it can probably be changed, so it's not all that important, but it's a fun little worldbuilding quirk of the ship.

Escape pod. 
- There's only one, and there aren't enough seats for everyone to go in it. One person has to get left behind. 
- It for sure won't come to that though, so, like the engine room, this isn't all that important.
